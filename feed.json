The increase in quality of art, level design, and visual storytelling now requires level designers to create sparse and empty locations where players can take in the beauty of the worlds they inhabit. The empty, barren spaces of Zelda: Breath of the Wild have a function in the world — to create a sense of mystery and exploration, or to simple bring some spatial serenity. The physical space of Red Dead Redemption 2 may be sparse to showcase the sense of wilderness yet untouched by civilisation, but the world is anything but sparse. Both these games are sandboxes with a highly complex ruleset in which the players can create their own joy, which is supplemented by the overarching level design of the world. Every mountain, valley, cliff, street, village, or structure can be explored. The sheer scale of the world space to accommodate all these locations, vistas, venues, and sets is tremendous, rivaling a real world experience of hiking or urban exploration.</p>\n<p id=\"2c05\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Besides the world itself, there are now many nuances to imitate real world situations — unique terrains and geological difficulties.

Arthur Morgan is a representative of the old wild cowboys- bulky physiques, laborious movement. The way he reacts to the controller lends to the fantasy, but it is simply not possible to use Arthur Morgan to traverse the wilderness of the world. Hence, the players get access to horses, coaches, and trains. All of these are built to cover vast distances and hence control much differently than Arthur.</p>\n<p id=\"57a1\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Covering the huge expanse demands a lot of time being spent on horseback, yet being on horseback is not the best of Red Dead 2.

His first outing under Rocksteady was a fairly linear, stealth game called Arkham Asylum, where he took advantage of ducts and overhead vantage points. He used his grappling gun to access spaces outside human reaches, and glided across architectural gorges to reach the other side. It was believable when the game was situated in the small and tight Arkham Asylum.<br>When Batman moved on to Arkham City, it was a different story. The same grappling hook was now used to traverse across a gigantic city, the gliding was used to cover distances spanning multiple city blocks. No Batman movie or comic is dominantly about Batman covering huge distances without his Bat-mobile, yet Arkham Asylum’s most dominant activity is traversing the city to reach locations. Yes, it is more dominant that the actual stealth, the star of the gameplay. Let us analyse the 3Cs of Arkham City and understand why it is not the best example when it comes to large scale traversal.</p>\n<p id=\"0b91\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Character</strong><br>Batman is a huge character. He is bulky, muscular, and wears a gigantic bat costume with pointy ears. He has tons of gadgets and has the grace of a monster truck (except when he is fighting). Also he is an actually huge character, taking a 3rd of the screen.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*CKM_RYQy1L4UKEe4zxmfGQ.jpeg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>Having an entire third dedicated to the character creates a sense of weight, mass, and claustrophobia</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"b9f8\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Batman has a grappling hook that he can shoot towards a grappling point. The hooks sinks in at such a point and drags him towards it. Batman can cancel the motion at any point and drop into a free fall, but he cannot change direction.<br>He is slightly more controllable when gliding, where he can change direction and pull a few maneuvers like diving to build up momentum before unfurling his cape and gaining a lot of height. He can also shoot his grapple while gliding, and use the momentum of the grapple gun to launch himself over huge distances. The launch is a huge affordance in a city where height differences between streets and rooftops is a lot.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*VPluM2-bpamtpR4pYW94qg.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>The momentum based launch is the first step to achieve any sense of momentum and verticality</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"b09c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Changing direction is a problem for Batman. Due to his rigid grappling hook, taking advantage of using himself as a pendulum across corners is impossible. Cornering using a mass and rope is a massive miss in a game all about ropes, mass, and grappling hooks. It constantly requires Batman to glide to navigate corners.</p>\n<p id=\"f7f2\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Controller</strong><br>Batman is pretty snappy when it comes to reacting to the controller, automatically locating and snapping to the edges of architecture. He travels mostly in straight lines and normal projectile curves when grappling. Batman actually shines when it comes to gliding as he has a much favourable sensitivity than compared to his on foot controls. It is possible to navigate tight spaces when gliding, and navigate tight vertical spaces using diving and cape lift-offs.</p>\n<p id=\"4d1c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Camera</strong><br>Of all the 3Cs, this one is the most bland in the Arkham Games. Batman’s motion is pretty independent of the camera, but the camera is very dependent on the character. Hence it difficult to align the character to where the player wants to look, but it automatically (and sometimes frustratingly) aligns to where the character is facing. It also does not use any sleek camera tricks that are used when capturing high velocity motion.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*Scc8KravfE47fJ9sDN_iWg.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>A camera that does not lend to the motion it is capturing contributes nothing</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"e2a5\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For a game that is dominantly large scale traversal, it fails to create and sense of thrill or excitement. At most, some motion lines are present and a change of distance between the character and camera. It lacks any dramatic change in FOV to bring focus and tunnel vision, it does not have auto pans and tilts to bring a sense of verticality, and lack dynamic distance change to bring a sense of acceleration. All pans and tilts are manually done as players use the controls to see anything besides where the character is heading. The only change in FOV occurs when Batman is using his grappling hook, not when he is gliding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2fb0\" class=\"acr abd ty bg abe ls acs lt lv lw act lx lz iy acu iz jc mc acv md mg mh acw mi ml acx bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Spider-Man 2018</h2>\n<p id=\"3021\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up abv yv yw ur abw yy yz za abx zc zd ze aby zg zh zi abz zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Unlike Batman, Spider-Man was very much made for large scale traversal. As this is the first entry in the series, Spider-Man was made from ground up with large scale traversal in mind. And unlike Batman, much of other Spider-Man media covers his relationship with a huge city like New York and how he manages the commute (with or without superpowers).<br>New York is not like Gotham though. While both feature tall skyscrapers, Gotham has a mix of building of various heights in the same place. New York on the other hand clubs tall building together, medium sized building together, and flatter architecture together. This eliminates any steps, ladders, and terraces in an area. When Spider-Man moves through a burrow/ block of New York, he travels through a uniform height of architecture. Which means the preferred height and scale of verticality does not change frequently and the player can focus on the pure horizontal motion of Spider-Man.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"zs\">\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"xx cp xy co xz cn se aca sf acb hb bi\">\n<div class=\"zn zo zp zq zr ac gv\">\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2400/1*dtkHhgL7ho_oPhfLZ_rDOw.jpeg\" width=\"702\" height=\"395\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2700/1*wikwLk3DHMsbg2KtC7H7UQ.jpeg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>Arkham City has a terracing effect while verticality of NYC is uniform for large chunks of area</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"hb bi hc hd he hf\">\n<p id=\"ddd5\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">While Batman’s motion originates from aiming and shooting a grapple hook at different distances and achieving verticality to launch himself, Spider-Man shows a more rhythmic horizontal motion where shooting webs is the rhythm rather than generating the force for launch and motion. Batman does not swing, he generates force so he can glide. Spider-Man swings, which introduces rhythm to the motion. This creates the first and a fundamental difference between the two games’ traversal and 3Cs. While I have no experience in Level Design, as a Gameplay Designer it is exceptionally important for the players to be able to experience spaces and volumes in a fun way.</p>\n<p id=\"f07f\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Character</strong><br>Spider-Man is a slim, lean, agile, and an athletic character. A huge part of Spider-Man is not only reaching from A to B, but the style in which he does it.

But unlike Batman, he is free to choose and change his direction right from the start.<br>Spider-Man actually achieves different horizontal velocities while swinging at different vertical heights. While this completely defies physics, this gives players a reason to vary their own sense of verticality. It is quite relaxed and leisurely at higher altitudes, which actually enhances the amazing view. Whereas the speed gained is amazing and thrilling at lower altitudes, which is massively enhanced by the challenge of dodging incoming traffic and slight loss of control due to the increased velocity.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*0z_tsEapGM0vkuL2aAT1Jg.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"zs\">\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"xx cp xy co xz cn se aca sf acb hb bi\">\n<div class=\"zn zo zp zq zr ac gv\"> </div>\n<div>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*D31-8RVpP1bU4oOTdzlbJw.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>Slower swing is more stylistic and leisurely whereas faster swing is more challenging and thrilling (and rewarding, when speed is crucial)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"hb bi hc hd he hf\">\n<p id=\"8a56\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Controller</strong><br>Spider-Man is much more reactive to the controller on his feet and in the air. While the game borrows a lot from the snappiness of the Arkham series, there is much more free form control when Spider-Man is swinging. This allows even better mobility and allows organic, physical dexterity to come into play.<br>One thing this game excels at is allowing Spider-Man to travel in style. Not only does he do a number of animations, but players can also do stunts with Spider-Man. This creates an intrinsic challenge where not only reaching from point A to B matters, but the style in which one reaches. It is largely optional, but for an activity that is so dominant of the player’s time and attention, it adds some change and inherent challenges to spice it up.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*7rIUt0hNSflVioGKfp4GUQ.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>The stunts offer to spice up long drawn session of simple traversal</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"f10e\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Camera</strong><br>The camera is one of the best aspects of Spider-Man. It does not only enable the fluid and well animated character, it enhances everything. It creates a sense of motion, momentum, acceleration, and change while anchoring it to a relevant three-dimensional context. There are many layers to the camera that individually react to the controller, so let’s tackle them one by one.</p>\n<p id=\"31bd\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Camera and controller</strong><br>The reason why Spider-Man feel so obedient is that he reacts to player intention more than Batman. The left analog stick is solely dedicated to controlling Spider-Man and right analog stick is dedicated to controlling the camera. But Spider-Man actually aligns himself to the camera, so it’s quite simple to steer him. It’s as easy as pointing the camera to where the player wants to be. So directing the character directly causes the camera to align, and directing the camera causes the character to align. Access to both these ways allows the system to be approachable by many different kinds of players. It also offers a chance for more experienced players seeking to utilise the system (I personally used the left stick for coarse alignment and right stick for fine adjustment)</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*pxkHHlKXXQvUVnn_tBew8Q.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>Turning the character causes the camera to cinematically follow</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*dHp48EBhMNb62qsfYgY5vA.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>Turning the camera allows to take sharper and reactionary turns that Spider-Man obeys gracefully</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"773b\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">With such a simple yet doubly faceted approach to camera, it’s no surprise that the cinematic scope of the camera is not lost regardless of Spider-Man existing and being used in a video games.</p>\n<p id=\"bcc6\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yv yw ur yy yz za zc zd ze zg zh zi zk zl fx zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Achieving the feel of beautiful motion</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"zn zo zp zq zr zs zy zz paragraph-image bi yc acl c post__image post__image--center\">\n<div class=\"zy zz acz\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 600px\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 600px\"><img role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></picture></div>\n<figcaption class=\"zv zw zx zy zz aba abb bg b bh ab dy\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Carefully calibrated distance between Spider-Man and the camera, along with some cinematic angles</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"3a55\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">While there are many nuances, this is the core rhythm of the camera movement.

Batman, as a character, has much more realistic depiction of mass. Batman actually has generate torque using physically (somewhat) realistic centrifugal force. This disables him from making sharp and acute turns to orient himself. On the other hand, Spider-Man defies many properties of physics. He unrealistically defies principles of torque, generating large centrifugal force despite having a very small radius (where r in mr² is unrealistically small). Yet the beauty of the motion and the way the camera presents it to us allows suspension of disbelief, and allows Spider-Man to take advantage of a better reacting controller.</p>\n<figure class=\"zn

It has to not just be functional anymore, to allow players to travel from point A to point B, but also be carefully crafted for a different kind of fun — passive fun. While it is a dominant activity, it will not be on the forefront of players’ minds when they are more focused on reaching the location to probably shoot, hack-n-slash, or solve a puzzle. But as games achieve a sense of wonder to invite exploration, large scale traversal has become one of the biggest priorities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8e85\" class=\"acr abd ty bg abe ls acs lt lv lw act lx lz iy acu iz jc mc acv md mg mh acw mi ml acx bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Some other examples</h2>\n<p id=\"0bc4\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up abv yv yw ur abw yy yz za abx zc zd ze aby zg zh zi abz zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Self sufficient characters are not the only options.

The horse has too many animations running when it turns, thereby increasing the turning radius to that of a limousine. While it tilts and aligns well on long distances, the animal has a tendency to collide against level design geometry. This becomes frustrating once we go to the denser and more detailed sections of the Witcher 3’s world.</p>\n<p id=\"a01a\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Meanwhile, all the psudo dino-horses from Horizon Zero Dawn were carefully crafted to create no nuisance while riding through the super dense world. The world is full of forest areas that have dense allocation of trees and rocks that would create a navigational nuisance if it were anything like the Witcher 3. Instead there are tricks under the hood that allow for some auto navigation and ease of life, which allow players to focus on other things like shooting while riding. After all, shooting on horseback becomes a very dominant activity when traversing between mission locations in a huge world. The character and controller are both very accommodating of the player and allow them to interact with the world in other ways than just to focus on the traversal, thereby reducing the monotonous nature of the activity.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"zs\">\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"xx cp xy co xz cn se aca sf acb hb bi\">\n<div class=\"zn zo zp zq zr ac gv\">\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*HG5wYU9ITZM1xArQubOSNg.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*qh9uHI5MQghFYk7IhQ49Lg.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>The devs explain the amazing system of affordances in their GDC talk <a class=\"ah oy\" href=\"https://youtu.be/TawhcWao9ls?t=844\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"hb bi hc hd he hf\">\n<p id=\"caac\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Such careful emphasis on a traversal system that actually de-escalates its importance in the player’s mind is a starkly different approach than Spider-Man where they allow the traversal system to shine on its own.</p>\n<p id=\"92de\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">While horses are becoming commonplace (along with bows), one of the greatest pioneers of large, open world games actually used a more modern vehicle — cars. GTA, Watch Dogs, Far Cry, and anything set in a modern time line all feature cars. Some open world games are made just for cars (such as Forza and Crew). Even Batman Arkham Knight, successor to Arkham City, features the Bat-Mobile as a dominant form of traversal. Some of these games also feature boats, jet-skis, planes, helicopters, etc. But the two games that I want to bring to light in this category are Saints Row 4 and Infamous Second Son.</p>\n<p id=\"87f0\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Saints Row 4 is the world from GTA but on performance steroids. While it doesn’t have the largest area, it does have some height to it. The game allows players to traverse using traditional cars, or even air space vehicles that can switch between hover mode and propulsion mode. This allows many ways and speeds at which the city can be experienced and destruction can be caused with.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"zs\">\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"xx cp xy co xz cn se aca sf acb hb bi\">\n<div class=\"zn zo zp zq zr ac gv\">\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*7D1O11im_a1kDd5OHiSRhQ.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"314\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*YURmeWFa0Zb77vmlD7qC2w.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>Crash physically with a car, or use high velocity jets to obliterate the world</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"hb bi hc hd he hf\">\n<p id=\"32ff\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">But the game goes one step further, it allows a self sufficient character who can travel without any vehicle.

While open spaces can be traversed in any way, most architectures come with one or two ability specific hook points. This creates a puzzle like approach to climbing and traversing massive buildings, ranging from sprouting wings and gliding, hovering on a smoke, or being a pure force of electricity. Various building and spaces demand the players to use these different abilities and their different traversal mechanics to keep variation in an otherwise monotonous task of moving between point A and

I was able to leverage Claude and build a prototype in less than a day that aggregated games news from Youtube, Twitch, and RSS feeds for video game publications (e.g. - IGN) and interperse that with content of games built on Immutable from Youtube. This allowed us to quickly test what is a healthy ratio of organic vs inorganic content and what barebones features are table stakes.</p>\n<p>Within just a day, I was able to prototype a simple web experience using javascript for frontend that leverages public APIs provided by these services. All of this was done using Claude in Cursor. I then deployed the webapp on Netlify so I could easily share it to anyone who needed to test it internally or externally.</p>\n<p>Instead of attaching screenshots, you can test the prototype yourself here<br><a href=\"https://gamerfeed.netlify.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://gamerfeed.netlify.app/</a><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n<p>GitHub repository<br><a href=\"https://github.com/bramb000/games-news-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/bramb000/games-news-feed</a></p>\n<p>Within 4 days we were able to quickly validate the requirements and scope of this project which was greatly assisted by a working, browser based prototype.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Result</h1>\n<p>The prototype did not proceed past the first few iterations as we quickly discovered the challenges of scaling it and the degree of its alignment with the company's strategy was a core prohibitve factor.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Learning</h1>\n<p>The lack of success on the project itself was far outweighed by the immense success of being able to execute concept to working prototype in hand within a day to validate at speed. This was one of my first AI assisted projects and was a core instigator of my AI adoption to increase speed 100x.

/wp:jetpack/layout-grid --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The tricky part was making a responsive UI was the 3 dimensional objects in the UI. For that, I worked very closely with the UI engineers to develop a system where an anchor point and multiple boundary points were projected from the 2D screen into a 3D space on the screen. Once the appropriate 3D anchor points were calculated for any screen the camera adjusted in such a way that the the 3D point was placed perfectly where the 2D point was supposed to be on the screen. The result was a reactive camera system that could be configured like a 2D UI and the camera would adapt automatically. Basically, it meant that 3D elements could be designed and treated as 2D elements in the UI.</p>\n<p>It would automatically know how much to zoom in or out and how to move left and right to make sure all the 3D objects appeared at the correct places on the screen no matter the aspect ratio and screen resolution of the device, whether it was a nearly square ipad or a really wide phone. The MVP of this solution achieved usable display results on over 8 types of aspect ratios and different devices which broadly encompassed 90% of the devices or screens we expected the app to be used on out of the box.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" data-publii-token=\"publii-1765863682621-qfqlau\"><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/IMG_0508.PNG\" alt=\"A diagram explaining how 3D coordinates are converted to 2D UI which is then used to control a 3D object like 2D UI element\" width=\"900\" height=\"872\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0508-xs.PNG 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0508-sm.PNG 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0508-md.PNG 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0508-lg.PNG 1024w\"></figure>\n<figcaption>Converting a 3D object into 2D coordinates, then applying responsive UI component rules to the 3D object, and then making the 3D object adjust by moving or zooming in and out to adjust to the new 2D coordinates on a different screen</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Here is the fundamental difference of how the UI with 3D objects are treated in Rocksmith+ compared to most other games (Call of Duty mobile used an example here)</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Frame-7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"540\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Frame-7-xs.png 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Frame-7-sm.png 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Frame-7-md.png 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Frame-7-lg.png 1024w\">\n<figcaption>You can see the overlap between the 2D and 3D elements when the screen becomes narrower, like on an ipad.

The original system, being built on solid technical foundations, meant that users could change their configuration at run time meaning they could change whenever they wanted and however many times they wanted.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>One of the final pieces was how users interact with the UI. Some users could be on a chair using a keyboard, some could be on a couch with a PS5 controller in one hand and a guitar in another, and some could be leaning over a stool to touch a tablet screen on their kitchen table. The environments and context ranged on a wide spectrum.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Since one single subscription of Rocksmith+ gave access to the game on every platform, we expected the user to using the app on multiple platforms - think Netflix where you use it on your TV, tablets, and sometimes phones. This is why we needed a consistent outcomes for users from the user actions on different platforms over and over again. Since their minds were occupied with guitar chords and other complex techniques, it made no sense to add the cognitive load of also learning how to interact with this app on multiple platforms.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/IMG_0492.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"289\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0492-xs.png 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0492-sm.png 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0492-md.png 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0492-lg.png 1024w\">\n<figcaption>The user knows what they want, but how do they recreate it on a different platform?</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The first version of a unified interaction system was an interaction matrix for achieving the most important outcomes.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:table --></p>\n<figure>I created a 3 dimensional interaction matrix that mapped outcome to a component to an action on platform and conducted many surveys to create an exhaustive list of what are the most commonly mapped translations between interactions.</figure>\n<figure>For example, hovering with a mouse cursor on desktop was majorly translated as touch and hold for users across various languages and countries, and while \"hover\" was the same on console it was from using the d-pad to navigate to the option as opposed to a freeform cursor.</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Interaction-Matrix-Abstraction.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"148\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Interaction-Matrix-Abstraction-xs.png 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Interaction-Matrix-Abstraction-sm.png 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Interaction-Matrix-Abstraction-md.png 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Interaction-Matrix-Abstraction-lg.png 1024w\">\n<figcaption>This is a sample abstraction of a complex interaction matrixaption</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Once I had collected an exhaustive list of what users commonly mapped various interactions on various platforms to specific outcomes, I made sure to map the mechanics of a device with each other to build a cohesive system so figure out how to unify them in in terms of implementation.</p>\n<p>For example, on PC, there is a UI event called hover which is activated when a cursor enters a region and does not exit the area or make an action like a click for 600 micro seconds. This is mapped to a user hovering on an item to want more information via a tooltip which is common in most software and games. <br>For touch devices, we had an event when a finger was placed on an item, but did not lift it up for 600 micro seconds. This registered as a tap and hold, which was also mapped to wanting more information through a tooltip about the item. In both cases, the help tooltip was created as a hovering element next to the original element so it wasn't obscured by the cursor or the finger.</p>\n<p>This ensured that under the hood, the technical interaction system was just as consistent as the outcomes of these interactions for the users which made it easy to maintain and scale the system rapidly as the number of screens and number of instances of a component started increasing exponentially later in development. Maintainability was greatly improved - for example, whenver the team wanted to change the time of hover or tap and hold from 600ms to 300ms for bringing up the tooltip, we would have to make the change in one place instead of maintaining two separate interaction patterns for the same outcome from a user's point of view</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"><!-- /wp:separator -->\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<h1>Result</h1>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Rocksmith+ launched in open beta and swiftly followed a global launch in 2022.

Alas, for another day.</span></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- /wp:details --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The averages are different and it explains correlation. But how do I know if the problem is with session per day and not with overall ability of the game to delight? If that were true, we would see very low engagement in the first session, but the opposite was true. The game had a healthy D1 retention compared to industry benchmarks which means that it was making an impression, just failing to build habits.</p>\n<p>This observation helped me craft the hypothesis that something was off in the return to the second session and onwards. The hypothesis was that either there are no more moments of delight from Day 2 onwards or there are too many points of friction. </p>\n<p>While both hypothesis needed to be tested, I opted to personally tackle the second point first as another part of the team had just finished updating animations and VFX which would overally increase the \"wow\" factor and it would be wise to wait to analyse the impact of those changes.</p>\n<p>Proceeding with the latter part of my hypothesis - in Guild of Guardians, you get gold and other resources for playing. And you can use those resources to get powerful heroes, stronger swords, and sturdier shields to defeat bigger monsters. What's the catch? If you don't login in enough times, you can get as much gold as you're supposed to. So you're weaker, the boss is more difficult because your weapons are weaker. This perfectly aligned with the original observation that users were logging in less than once per daily.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>To make certain that I was chasing the correct lead, I asked the community manager for permission and pasted the following question in Discord</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:image {\"id\":87,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-image-87 post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Discord-Question.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-xs.png 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-sm.png 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-md.png 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-lg.png 1024w\"></figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>And came in hundreds of responses</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:image {\"id\":89,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-image-89 post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Discord-responses-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-xs.png 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-sm.png 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-md.png 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-lg.png 1024w\"></figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:image {\"id\":90,\"width\":\"607px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized wp-image-90 post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 900px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Discord-Responses.png\" alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-xs.png 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-sm.png 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-md.png 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-lg.png 1024w\"></figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>There was a question about how the game fits in people's lifestyle.

Changing their behaviour to do what we wanted was going to be futile. Additionally, survivor bias had to be eliminated as people who churned did not answer these surveys, so a buffer was added to not overestimate how much users claimed to engage.</p>\n<p>This helped me craft a clear persona that we were designing for - The Casual Connoisseur. They are characterised by someone who spend thousand of hours in a game, but at the start will casually try it before commiting. We were attracting a bulk of this audience via our marketing campaigns but had not adjusted our progression and pivoted our feature set to retain and hook this persona.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<hr>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Solution</p>\n<p>At the current state of the game, you needed to spend 1 energy to defeat monsters automatically and automatically get gold. Given how we designed the product, a user had to login 3 times a day to get the most rewards. We just saw with data and opinions that such a cadence does not fit in the lifestyle of most of our players. And if they did not login 3 times a day, they will never get strong enough to win successfully.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So we had to do two things, build habits, and build them within a busy lifestyle.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In the original flow, users had to come back to take an action and be rewarded. This did not generate any anticipation excitement at the end of your previous session for you to not forget this game and want to come back.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-image-108 post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/storyboard-for-setting-up-next-session.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/storyboard-for-setting-up-next-session-xs.jpg 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/storyboard-for-setting-up-next-session-sm.jpg 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/storyboard-for-setting-up-next-session-md.jpg 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/storyboard-for-setting-up-next-session-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure>\n<p>Additionally, it was important to end a game session on a high note and make the player look forward to playing the next time as opposed to making them stop playing and forcing them away.

This means that when they are ready to leave the game, we can seed the anticipation by telling users that they will have rewards waiting for them. And when they come back, the new session will begin with a moment of delight. After a workshop sessions to let everyone have input and provide feedback and a technical review, we aligned on the specific version of our feature.</p>\n<p>After the team agreed on the new user flow and the end goal of this design, I had to create 3 new UI components - A button on the main menu for this new feature, a screen for the new feature, and the tutorial for the new feature.</p>\n<p>I set out to mock up the new user flow with a combinations of existing and new screens in Figma to be able to map out how much new UI work was needed.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Figma-User-Flow-Rough.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"434\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-Rough-xs.png 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-Rough-sm.png 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-Rough-md.png 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-Rough-lg.png 1024w\">\n<figcaption>Mocking up a super quick user flow with greybox wireframes to validate the hypothesis</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The first two iteration were greybox wireframes to explore what was an appropriate amount of information</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/afk-rewards-test-1.png\" data-size=\"2316x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/afk-rewards-test-1-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"358\"></a>\n<figcaption>Iteration 1</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/afk-rewards-test-2.png\" data-size=\"2316x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/afk-rewards-test-2-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"358\"></a>\n<figcaption>Iteration 2</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>I received heavy critical feedback from another UX designer and my team's UI designer that both these version were extremely content heavy.

The engineer on my team wanted to change this to a simple button for clarity but the UI artist made a great observation that we will not be able to do complex, eye catching, and delightful animations and VFX's with a button as well as with an image. Some examples of these improvements were that the chest would physically fill up with more coins as it collected rewards.</p>\n<p>With alignment and buy-in from the engineering team that we want to pursue using a custom image, I decided a tutorial for the first visit to this screen was the best solution to teach the player that something which does not look like a button is actually a button. During testing, we also found out this lesson had a 100% memorisation rate, that means all of our participants of the playtest could remember the action 24 hours after the tutorial.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/afk-tutorial.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"420\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/afk-tutorial-xs.png 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/afk-tutorial-sm.png 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/afk-tutorial-md.png 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/afk-tutorial-lg.png 1024w\">\n<figcaption>This is the quick and greybox tutorial I mocked up in Figma.

Suriprisingly, only 12% players closed it using the dialogue.

The progression worked in such a way that players would unlock a weapon to create excitement, but by the time they collected all the gold to acquire that weapon, they would also simultaneously unlock the next sword. This dampened the excitement of the reward they just received in the form of the sword, and every milestone went from being an opportunity to celebrate to a moment of setting a new goal without acknowledgement. <br><br>The simplest fix was restructuring the existing progression in such a way that players would get all the gold required to unlock a sword over time, and they would unlock the new sword more or less around the time they got all the required gold. This created a satisfying moment upon return where players would get a sword after progressing through the campaign and immediately get to use it to kill stronger enemies. This was a pretty invisible and not related to the UI - but a highly impactful and under the hood change that made a world of difference. I need to be extra careful with this particular change as I did not want to give the player too many rewards and cannibalise monetisation.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: inherit;\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/IMG_0495.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"419\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-xs.png 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-sm.png 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-md.png 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-lg.png 1024w\">\n<figcaption>User experience is a lot about feelings and sometimes those feelings are beyond the influence of pure visual design.

I went around the office and asked employees who did not work on Guild of Guardians but played it regularly for their unbiased feedback on this specific issue.

After a quick workshop with my team we discovered that the easiest and simplest solution we arrived to was adding a reccomendation system to the progression using server wide hero usage data.</p>\n<p>Here is how the experience looked like previously and then after the new feature was added</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250828_080318_Guild-of-Guardians-2.png\" data-size=\"2316x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250828_080318_Guild-of-Guardians-2-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"358\"></a>\n<figcaption>Before - players had no clue what heroes to use</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150237_Guild-of-Guardians-2.png\" data-size=\"2316x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150237_Guild-of-Guardians-2-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"358\"></a>\n<figcaption>After - players had some recommendations based on other players' performance</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>This feature was tricky to analyse because the feature was not clickable to the user, they could only read this information. So I had no way of knowing if it was helping or not. A proxy data I used was to observe how many users used teams that were different from the recommendations in their first attempt and then used the recommended team in the next attempt to then clear the dungeon. The success of this funnel was increasing for multiple weeks until it settled in the high 60%, so I could inferred that users did get information from this feature to be able to positively impact their ability to win.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Through qualitative insights from talking to players informally via Discord and analysing the conversations using AI tools, I also found out that players quit after losing once or twice because whenever they lost in a dungeon, they had to begin from the first dungeon. This design was an ill fit for a mobile game which easier and smoother progression. I collaborated directly with the game designer to add a new dungeon progression system that used checkpoints so players can instantly reattempt the dungeon that they lost at instead of having to begin from the start. This was a simply and purely UX change as no balancing or remaking of content was involved.</p>\n<p>Here is how the experience looked like previously and then after the new feature was added</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250915_114738_Guild-of-Guardians.png\" data-size=\"2316x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250915_114738_Guild-of-Guardians-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"358\"></a>\n<figcaption>Before - players said that they had no sense of progression, and if they lost at room 13 of a dungeon they had to reattempt from the start</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150223_Guild-of-Guardians-1.png\" data-size=\"2316x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150223_Guild-of-Guardians-1-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"358\"></a>\n<figcaption>After - a clear progression path. And if players lost at room 5, they could reattempt from room 5</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<hr>\n<p>The next piece was to add a goal at the end of the 7 days to build anticipation and increase the odds of retaining to day 7.</p>\n<p>Since our game had a plethora of legendary heroes that players wanted and would open gacha for and hope to get, I created a 7 day reward that let you pick 1 legendary guardian. This let players experience choice and autonomy at the end of long commitment. The hypothesis was that delayed gratification would make players stay longer than day 7 in anticipation of further dopamine rushes. The UI design for this feature was specifically chosen to look like a countdown calendar so the players had something to look forward to not only the next day but also a bumper reward at the end of the week.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"420\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-xs.png 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-sm.png 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-md.png 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-lg.png 1024w\">\n<figcaption>Daily instant gratification rewards to create micro goals and a big delayed gratification reward at the end of the week with clear goals, context, and progress to create macro goals</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr>\n<p>One of the final changes that I added under this block of work was a moment of delight at getting the players first legendary hero. Originally players had to wait to get one from gacha or the newly implemented day 7 calendar rewards, but I added an explicit scripted moment to get the first legendary hero after defeating the first boss to make it feel celebratory and achieved by playing the game.</p>\n<p>This decision was not informed by pre-prepared data as it is hard to analyse something that does not exist, so we A/B tested this implementation to see the impact. The players who got to experience this showed 38% higher likelihood of retaining to D7 than players who did not, which was made obvious by seeing the usage data of that legendary hero to clear out the subsequent dungeons.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/image-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"396\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/image-3-xs.png 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/image-3-sm.png 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/image-3-md.png 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/image-3-lg.png 1024w\">\n<figcaption>I created this design in Figma with existing components of the design system as we did not have the availability of a UI designer for this feature</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>After the success of this moment of delight, I added a introductory offer with clear messaging to be paired with the delight for players who wished to fast track their progress in the campaign. Compared to our old, outdated introductory offer, it performed 26% better against new players and increased the odds of a purchase making player to retain to day 7 by 92% higher than a player who did not purchase this offer. </p>\n<p><em>I also defined the price and pricing strategy for this offer by multivariate testing 3 different price options to optimise for conversion and retention. I used linear regression analysis to model the impact of price on both of these metrics.

The \"average\" fell down to 1, but more users were playing once per day and overall less users churned from the game and improved D7 retention.</p>\n<p>In nerd terms - the bimodal distribution eventually regressed to a normal distribution, and fewer overall players churned after solving user pain points. What this means was that we no longer had a k-shaped behaviour where the most engaged players were playing so much that it pulled the average up and gave us the wrong impression of the game.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Smoother-Bell-Curve.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"552\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Smoother-Bell-Curve-xs.png 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Smoother-Bell-Curve-sm.png 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Smoother-Bell-Curve-md.png 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Smoother-Bell-Curve-lg.png 1024w\"></figure>\n<figcaption>The \"average\" is lower but the outcome is more consistent for more players than before with overall higher retention. That's the beauty of really understanding statistics and numbers</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>While it is difficult to attribute the results to any single change, we continuously monitored data and collected qualitative feedback through community managers engaging with the player base to gauge the estimated weighted impact of individual changes and, unsurpisingly, it followed an 80/20 principle i.e major impact came from the earliest, biggest changes (such as building up the away from keyboard idle rewards and readjusting some of the milestones and rewards) and  and the marginal gains of impact from later, smaller changes became smaller and smaller.</p>\n<p>At that point, it made sense for me to propose to our Executive Producer to dissolve the \"D7 Retention\" strike team and reallocate people to other features in development.</p>\n<p>Additionally, using free content to grab the players attention followed by a surgically placed in-app offer with very clear messaging and value proposition increased our D7 LTV (money made from a player within their first 7 days from creating an account) by over 12%! Even though this was not our goal, this was a double win for the team.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Outcome-2-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"276\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Outcome-2-2-xs.png 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Outcome-2-2-sm.png 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Outcome-2-2-md.png 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Outcome-2-2-lg.png 1024w\"></figure>\n<hr>\n<h1>Learning</h1>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This was a major block of work that took multiple months and was shipped over multiple releases. The discovery phase started by understanding that what players are lacking is beyond the screen, it's a mismatch of the game's user experience and their habits and lifestyle. Once we understood that, we knew we had to make critical changes to features besides just updating the UI.</p>\n<p>But with hypothesis and insights backed by data about player behaviour, we could confidently commit to this long endeavour to deliver value with constant iteration and see each addition having an impact on our business goals.
