I was able to leverage Claude and build a prototype in less than a day that aggregated games news from Youtube, Twitch, and RSS feeds for video game publications (e.g. - IGN) and interperse that with content of games built on Immutable from Youtube. This allowed us to quickly test what is a healthy ratio of organic vs inorganic content and what barebones features are table stakes.</p>\n<p>Within just a day, I was able to prototype a simple web experience using js for frontend that leverages public APIs provided by these services. All of this was done using Claude in Cursor. I then deployed the webapp on Netlify so I could easily share it to anyone who needed to test it internally or externally.</p>\n<p>You can test the prototype yourself here<br><a>https://gamerfeed.netlify.app/</a><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n<p>GitHub repository<br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/bramb000/games-news-feed</a></p>\n<p>Within 4 days we were able to quickly validate the requirements and scope of this project which was greatly assisted by a working, browser based prototype.</p>\n<h1>Result</h1>\n<p>The project did not proceed past the first few iterations as a prototype as we quickly discovered the challenges of scaling it and the degree of its alignment with the company's strategy was a core prohibitve factor.</p>\n<h1>Learning</h1>\n<p>The lack of success on the project itself was far outweighed by the immense success of being able to execute concept to working prototype in hand within a day to validate at speed. This was one of my first AI assisted projects and was a core instigator of my AI adoption to increase speed 100x. In my previous life as an amateur engineer such a project would have taken me at least 5 days.</p>",

/wp:jetpack/layout-grid --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The tricky part was making a responsive UI was the 3 dimensional objects in a virtual space. For that, I worked very closely with the UI engineers to develop a system where an anchor point was projected from the 3D dimension space into a 2D space on the screen, and the anchor point was then subjected to laws of bounds. Once the appropriate 2D anchor point was calculated for any screen, the camera adjusted in such a way that the 3D projection of it aligned as closely as possible. The result was a reactive camera system that could be configured like a 2D UI and the camera would adapt automatically. It would automatically know how much to zoom in or out and how to move left and right to make sure all the 3D objects appeared at the correct places on the screen no matter the aspect ratio and screen resolution of the device, whether it was a nearly square Ipad or a really tall phone. The MVP of this solution achieved usable display results on over 8 types of aspect ratios and different devices which broadly encompassed 90% of the devices or screens we expected the app to be used on</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/unnamed-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1193\" height=\"1410\"

You would do the same on a game console by using the bumper buttons. But on a touch device, do you remember the last time you clicked a button to scroll? Instead you will see your feed extends beyond the screen, and you simply scroll to access those items outside the screen. The UI is built to lead to and teach these natural behaviours that Rocksmith's prototype version was missing as it was built PC first. A large part of my role was making all these small changes to the global design system and its component libraries to improve intuitiveness on mobile, PC, and consoles.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/unnamed-3-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1868\" height=\"812\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/unnamed-3-3-xs.jpg 300w ,https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/unnamed-3-3-sm.jpg 480w ,https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/unnamed-3-3-md.jpg 768w ,https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/unnamed-3-3-lg.jpg 1024w\"></figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:image {\"id\":98,\"width\":\"690px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Accessibility was a core tenet of the experience we set out to design, this included the ability to users to customise the experience to their needs. One of the first accessibility feature we developed was allowing users to modify the scale of their UI to fine tune their mobile and tablet experience based on how far they kept their device. The distance between player and device heavily changed based on whether they were advanced guitar players or beginners, whether they played easy or difficult songs, whether they played bass or guitar, whether they played a full 34\" bass or some other size, or if they played different guitars, whether they had equipment such as pedals, amps, or headphones attached. </p>\n<figure

dynamic system to make our 3D UI responsive. The original system, being built on solid technical foundations, meant that users could change their configuration at run time meaning they could change whenever they wanted and however many times they wanted.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>One of the final pieces was how players interact with the UI. Some players could be on a chair using a keyboard, some could be on a couch with a PS5 controller in one hand and a guitar in another, and some could be leaning over a stool to touch a tablet screen on their kitchen table. The environments and context ranged on a wide spectrum.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This is why we needed a consistent interaction system so outcomes could result from the same user actions over and over again. Since their minds and memories were occupied with guitar chords and other complex techniques, it made no sense to burden them needing to learn how to operate this UI.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The first version of a unified interaction system was an interaction matrix for achieving the most important outcomes</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:table --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table class=\"has-fixed-layout align-center\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 90%; height: 1190px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 19.4435%;\">Outcome -&gt;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.2748%;\">Input (Confirmation, Cancellation, Selection)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.7248%;\">See More in a Scroll Group</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.2998%;\">Get more information</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.106%;\">Return to previous state (Not confirmation)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2373%;\"><em>more actions.....</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 19.4435%;\">Component ↓</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.2748%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.7248%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.2998%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.106%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2373%;\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 19.4435%;\">Button</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.2748%;\">Left Mouse Click or Enter Key (PC)<br>Single Tap (Mobile)<br>Press (A) or (X) (Game Consoles)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.7248%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.2998%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.106%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2373%;\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 19.4435%;\">Information Tooltip</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.2748%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.7248%;\">Mouse Wheel Scroll (PC)<br>Scroll With Finger (Mobile)<br>Highlight Out of Screen Component (Game Console)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.2998%;\">Cursor Hover (PC)<br>Tap and hold (Mobile)<br>Highlight (Game Consoles)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.106%;\">Escape hover region (PC)<br>Leave hold (Mobile)<br>Press</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2373%;\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 19.4435%;\">Content Card</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.2748%;\">Left Mouse Click or Enter Key (PC)<br>Single Tap (Mobile)<br>Press (A) or (X) (Game Consoles)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.7248%;\">Mouse Wheel Scroll (PC)<br>Scroll With Finger (Mobile)<br>Highlight Out of Screen Component (Game Console)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.2998%;\">Cursor Hover (PC)<br>Tap and hold (Mobile)<br>Highlight (Game Consoles)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.106%;\">Escape Key or Click Close (PC)<br>Tap Close (Mobile)<br>Press (B) or (O) (Game Console)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2373%;\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 19.4435%;\"><em>more components.....</em></td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.2748%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.7248%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.2998%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.106%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2373%;\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">This is a sample abstraction of a complex interaction matrix</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Once we had a consistent mapping between common outcomes that users wanted and consistent mapping the same actions to them, we then made sure to map the mechanics of a device with each other to build a cohesive system that is technically sound. For example, on PC, there is a UI event called hover which is activated when a cursor enters a region and does not exit the area or make an action like a click for 600 micro seconds. This is mapped to a player hovering on an item to want more information which is common in most digital applications. For touch devices, we had an event a finger was placed on an item, but did not lift it up for 600 micro seconds. This registered as a tap and hold, which was also mapped to wanting \"more information\" about the item the player tapped and held. In both cases, the help tooltip was created as a hovering element next to the original element so it wasn't obscured by the cursor or the finger. This ensured that under the hood, the technical interaction system was just as consistent as the outcomes of these interactions for the users which made it easy to maintain and scale the system rapidly as the number of screens and number of instances of a component started increasing exponentially later in development.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"><!-- /wp:separator -->\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<h1>Result</h1>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Rocksmith+ launched in open beta and swiftly followed a global launch in 2022.

This was further challenged by language and cultural barriers during COVID 19, and meant we had to take an approach of overcommunication and active building of interpersonal relationships.

Turns out it only explain 24% of the variance in the model, but the result is significant and the odds ratio explains that every 1 unit increase in average sessions/day would increase probability of player retaining by 16%.

If you don't login in enough times, you can get as much gold as you're supposed to. So you're weaker, the boss is more difficult because your weapons are rustier.

Changing their behaviour to do what we wanted was going to be futile. Additionally, survivor bias had to be eliminated as people who churned did not answer these surveys, so a buffer was added to not overestimate how much users claimed to engage.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So comes the solution</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>At the current state of the game, you needed to spend 1 energy to defeat monsters automatically and automatically get gold. Given how we designed the product, a user had to login 3 times a day to get the most rewards. We just saw with data and opinions that such a cadence does not fit in the lifestyle of most of our players. And if they did not login 3 times a day, they will never get strong enough to win successfully.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So we had to do two things, build habits, and build them within a busy lifestyle.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In the original flow, users had to come back to take an action and be rewarded.
