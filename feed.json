The increase in quality of art, level design, and visual storytelling now requires level designers to create sparse and empty locations where players can take in the beauty of the worlds they inhabit. The empty, barren spaces of Zelda: Breath of the Wild have a function in the world — to create a sense of mystery and exploration, or to simple bring some spatial serenity. The physical space of Red Dead Redemption 2 may be sparse to showcase the sense of wilderness yet untouched by civilisation, but the world is anything but sparse. Both these games are sandboxes with a highly complex ruleset in which the players can create their own joy, which is supplemented by the overarching level design of the world. Every mountain, valley, cliff, street, village, or structure can be explored. The sheer scale of the world space to accommodate all these locations, vistas, venues, and sets is tremendous, rivaling a real world experience of hiking or urban exploration.</p>\n<p id=\"2c05\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Besides the world itself, there are now many nuances to imitate real world situations — unique terrains and geological difficulties.

Arthur Morgan is a representative of the old wild cowboys- bulky physiques, laborious movement. The way he reacts to the controller lends to the fantasy, but it is simply not possible to use Arthur Morgan to traverse the wilderness of the world. Hence, the players get access to horses, coaches, and trains. All of these are built to cover vast distances and hence control much differently than Arthur.</p>\n<p id=\"57a1\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Covering the huge expanse demands a lot of time being spent on horseback, yet being on horseback is not the best of Red Dead 2.

His first outing under Rocksteady was a fairly linear, stealth game called Arkham Asylum, where he took advantage of ducts and overhead vantage points. He used his grappling gun to access spaces outside human reaches, and glided across architectural gorges to reach the other side. It was believable when the game was situated in the small and tight Arkham Asylum.<br>When Batman moved on to Arkham City, it was a different story. The same grappling hook was now used to traverse across a gigantic city, the gliding was used to cover distances spanning multiple city blocks. No Batman movie or comic is dominantly about Batman covering huge distances without his Bat-mobile, yet Arkham Asylum’s most dominant activity is traversing the city to reach locations. Yes, it is more dominant that the actual stealth, the star of the gameplay. Let us analyse the 3Cs of Arkham City and understand why it is not the best example when it comes to large scale traversal.</p>\n<p id=\"0b91\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Character</strong><br>Batman is a huge character. He is bulky, muscular, and wears a gigantic bat costume with pointy ears. He has tons of gadgets and has the grace of a monster truck (except when he is fighting). Also he is an actually huge character, taking a 3rd of the screen.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*CKM_RYQy1L4UKEe4zxmfGQ.jpeg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>Having an entire third dedicated to the character creates a sense of weight, mass, and claustrophobia</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"b9f8\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Batman has a grappling hook that he can shoot towards a grappling point. The hooks sinks in at such a point and drags him towards it. Batman can cancel the motion at any point and drop into a free fall, but he cannot change direction.<br>He is slightly more controllable when gliding, where he can change direction and pull a few maneuvers like diving to build up momentum before unfurling his cape and gaining a lot of height. He can also shoot his grapple while gliding, and use the momentum of the grapple gun to launch himself over huge distances. The launch is a huge affordance in a city where height differences between streets and rooftops is a lot.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*VPluM2-bpamtpR4pYW94qg.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>The momentum based launch is the first step to achieve any sense of momentum and verticality</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"b09c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Changing direction is a problem for Batman. Due to his rigid grappling hook, taking advantage of using himself as a pendulum across corners is impossible. Cornering using a mass and rope is a massive miss in a game all about ropes, mass, and grappling hooks. It constantly requires Batman to glide to navigate corners.</p>\n<p id=\"f7f2\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Controller</strong><br>Batman is pretty snappy when it comes to reacting to the controller, automatically locating and snapping to the edges of architecture. He travels mostly in straight lines and normal projectile curves when grappling. Batman actually shines when it comes to gliding as he has a much favourable sensitivity than compared to his on foot controls. It is possible to navigate tight spaces when gliding, and navigate tight vertical spaces using diving and cape lift-offs.</p>\n<p id=\"4d1c\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Camera</strong><br>Of all the 3Cs, this one is the most bland in the Arkham Games. Batman’s motion is pretty independent of the camera, but the camera is very dependent on the character. Hence it difficult to align the character to where the player wants to look, but it automatically (and sometimes frustratingly) aligns to where the character is facing. It also does not use any sleek camera tricks that are used when capturing high velocity motion.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*Scc8KravfE47fJ9sDN_iWg.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>A camera that does not lend to the motion it is capturing contributes nothing</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"e2a5\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For a game that is dominantly large scale traversal, it fails to create and sense of thrill or excitement. At most, some motion lines are present and a change of distance between the character and camera. It lacks any dramatic change in FOV to bring focus and tunnel vision, it does not have auto pans and tilts to bring a sense of verticality, and lack dynamic distance change to bring a sense of acceleration. All pans and tilts are manually done as players use the controls to see anything besides where the character is heading. The only change in FOV occurs when Batman is using his grappling hook, not when he is gliding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2fb0\" class=\"acr abd ty bg abe ls acs lt lv lw act lx lz iy acu iz jc mc acv md mg mh acw mi ml acx bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Spider-Man 2018</h2>\n<p id=\"3021\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up abv yv yw ur abw yy yz za abx zc zd ze aby zg zh zi abz zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Unlike Batman, Spider-Man was very much made for large scale traversal. As this is the first entry in the series, Spider-Man was made from ground up with large scale traversal in mind. And unlike Batman, much of other Spider-Man media covers his relationship with a huge city like New York and how he manages the commute (with or without superpowers).<br>New York is not like Gotham though. While both feature tall skyscrapers, Gotham has a mix of building of various heights in the same place. New York on the other hand clubs tall building together, medium sized building together, and flatter architecture together. This eliminates any steps, ladders, and terraces in an area. When Spider-Man moves through a burrow/ block of New York, he travels through a uniform height of architecture. Which means the preferred height and scale of verticality does not change frequently and the player can focus on the pure horizontal motion of Spider-Man.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"zs\">\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"xx cp xy co xz cn se aca sf acb hb bi\">\n<div class=\"zn zo zp zq zr ac gv\">\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2400/1*dtkHhgL7ho_oPhfLZ_rDOw.jpeg\" width=\"702\" height=\"395\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2700/1*wikwLk3DHMsbg2KtC7H7UQ.jpeg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>Arkham City has a terracing effect while verticality of NYC is uniform for large chunks of area</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"hb bi hc hd he hf\">\n<p id=\"ddd5\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">While Batman’s motion originates from aiming and shooting a grapple hook at different distances and achieving verticality to launch himself, Spider-Man shows a more rhythmic horizontal motion where shooting webs is the rhythm rather than generating the force for launch and motion. Batman does not swing, he generates force so he can glide. Spider-Man swings, which introduces rhythm to the motion. This creates the first and a fundamental difference between the two games’ traversal and 3Cs. While I have no experience in Level Design, as a Gameplay Designer it is exceptionally important for the players to be able to experience spaces and volumes in a fun way.</p>\n<p id=\"f07f\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Character</strong><br>Spider-Man is a slim, lean, agile, and an athletic character. A huge part of Spider-Man is not only reaching from A to B, but the style in which he does it.

But unlike Batman, he is free to choose and change his direction right from the start.<br>Spider-Man actually achieves different horizontal velocities while swinging at different vertical heights. While this completely defies physics, this gives players a reason to vary their own sense of verticality. It is quite relaxed and leisurely at higher altitudes, which actually enhances the amazing view. Whereas the speed gained is amazing and thrilling at lower altitudes, which is massively enhanced by the challenge of dodging incoming traffic and slight loss of control due to the increased velocity.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*0z_tsEapGM0vkuL2aAT1Jg.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"zs\">\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"xx cp xy co xz cn se aca sf acb hb bi\">\n<div class=\"zn zo zp zq zr ac gv\"> </div>\n<div>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*D31-8RVpP1bU4oOTdzlbJw.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>Slower swing is more stylistic and leisurely whereas faster swing is more challenging and thrilling (and rewarding, when speed is crucial)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"hb bi hc hd he hf\">\n<p id=\"8a56\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Controller</strong><br>Spider-Man is much more reactive to the controller on his feet and in the air. While the game borrows a lot from the snappiness of the Arkham series, there is much more free form control when Spider-Man is swinging. This allows even better mobility and allows organic, physical dexterity to come into play.<br>One thing this game excels at is allowing Spider-Man to travel in style. Not only does he do a number of animations, but players can also do stunts with Spider-Man. This creates an intrinsic challenge where not only reaching from point A to B matters, but the style in which one reaches. It is largely optional, but for an activity that is so dominant of the player’s time and attention, it adds some change and inherent challenges to spice it up.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*7rIUt0hNSflVioGKfp4GUQ.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>The stunts offer to spice up long drawn session of simple traversal</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"f10e\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Camera</strong><br>The camera is one of the best aspects of Spider-Man. It does not only enable the fluid and well animated character, it enhances everything. It creates a sense of motion, momentum, acceleration, and change while anchoring it to a relevant three-dimensional context. There are many layers to the camera that individually react to the controller, so let’s tackle them one by one.</p>\n<p id=\"31bd\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Camera and controller</strong><br>The reason why Spider-Man feel so obedient is that he reacts to player intention more than Batman. The left analog stick is solely dedicated to controlling Spider-Man and right analog stick is dedicated to controlling the camera. But Spider-Man actually aligns himself to the camera, so it’s quite simple to steer him. It’s as easy as pointing the camera to where the player wants to be. So directing the character directly causes the camera to align, and directing the camera causes the character to align. Access to both these ways allows the system to be approachable by many different kinds of players. It also offers a chance for more experienced players seeking to utilise the system (I personally used the left stick for coarse alignment and right stick for fine adjustment)</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*pxkHHlKXXQvUVnn_tBew8Q.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>Turning the character causes the camera to cinematically follow</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*dHp48EBhMNb62qsfYgY5vA.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>Turning the camera allows to take sharper and reactionary turns that Spider-Man obeys gracefully</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"773b\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">With such a simple yet doubly faceted approach to camera, it’s no surprise that the cinematic scope of the camera is not lost regardless of Spider-Man existing and being used in a video games.</p>\n<p id=\"bcc6\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yv yw ur yy yz za zc zd ze zg zh zi zk zl fx zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"yt lr\">Achieving the feel of beautiful motion</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"zn zo zp zq zr zs zy zz paragraph-image bi yc acl c post__image post__image--center\">\n<div class=\"zy zz acz\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/format:webp/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 600px\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 600px\"><img role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*wrLWctCdqy9w8EyPxHP2EA.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></picture></div>\n<figcaption class=\"zv zw zx zy zz aba abb bg b bh ab dy\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Carefully calibrated distance between Spider-Man and the camera, along with some cinematic angles</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p id=\"3a55\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">While there are many nuances, this is the core rhythm of the camera movement.

Batman, as a character, has much more realistic depiction of mass. Batman actually has generate torque using physically (somewhat) realistic centrifugal force. This disables him from making sharp and acute turns to orient himself. On the other hand, Spider-Man defies many properties of physics. He unrealistically defies principles of torque, generating large centrifugal force despite having a very small radius (where r in mr² is unrealistically small). Yet the beauty of the motion and the way the camera presents it to us allows suspension of disbelief, and allows Spider-Man to take advantage of a better reacting controller.</p>\n<figure class=\"zn

It has to not just be functional anymore, to allow players to travel from point A to point B, but also be carefully crafted for a different kind of fun — passive fun. While it is a dominant activity, it will not be on the forefront of players’ minds when they are more focused on reaching the location to probably shoot, hack-n-slash, or solve a puzzle. But as games achieve a sense of wonder to invite exploration, large scale traversal has become one of the biggest priorities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8e85\" class=\"acr abd ty bg abe ls acs lt lv lw act lx lz iy acu iz jc mc acv md mg mh acw mi ml acx bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Some other examples</h2>\n<p id=\"0bc4\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up abv yv yw ur abw yy yz za abx zc zd ze aby zg zh zi abz zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Self sufficient characters are not the only options.

The horse has too many animations running when it turns, thereby increasing the turning radius to that of a limousine. While it tilts and aligns well on long distances, the animal has a tendency to collide against level design geometry. This becomes frustrating once we go to the denser and more detailed sections of the Witcher 3’s world.</p>\n<p id=\"a01a\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Meanwhile, all the psudo dino-horses from Horizon Zero Dawn were carefully crafted to create no nuisance while riding through the super dense world. The world is full of forest areas that have dense allocation of trees and rocks that would create a navigational nuisance if it were anything like the Witcher 3. Instead there are tricks under the hood that allow for some auto navigation and ease of life, which allow players to focus on other things like shooting while riding. After all, shooting on horseback becomes a very dominant activity when traversing between mission locations in a huge world. The character and controller are both very accommodating of the player and allow them to interact with the world in other ways than just to focus on the traversal, thereby reducing the monotonous nature of the activity.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"zs\">\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"xx cp xy co xz cn se aca sf acb hb bi\">\n<div class=\"zn zo zp zq zr ac gv\">\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*HG5wYU9ITZM1xArQubOSNg.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*qh9uHI5MQghFYk7IhQ49Lg.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>The devs explain the amazing system of affordances in their GDC talk <a class=\"ah oy\" href=\"https://youtu.be/TawhcWao9ls?t=844\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"hb bi hc hd he hf\">\n<p id=\"caac\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Such careful emphasis on a traversal system that actually de-escalates its importance in the player’s mind is a starkly different approach than Spider-Man where they allow the traversal system to shine on its own.</p>\n<p id=\"92de\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">While horses are becoming commonplace (along with bows), one of the greatest pioneers of large, open world games actually used a more modern vehicle — cars. GTA, Watch Dogs, Far Cry, and anything set in a modern time line all feature cars. Some open world games are made just for cars (such as Forza and Crew). Even Batman Arkham Knight, successor to Arkham City, features the Bat-Mobile as a dominant form of traversal. Some of these games also feature boats, jet-skis, planes, helicopters, etc. But the two games that I want to bring to light in this category are Saints Row 4 and Infamous Second Son.</p>\n<p id=\"87f0\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Saints Row 4 is the world from GTA but on performance steroids. While it doesn’t have the largest area, it does have some height to it. The game allows players to traverse using traditional cars, or even air space vehicles that can switch between hover mode and propulsion mode. This allows many ways and speeds at which the city can be experienced and destruction can be caused with.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"zs\">\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"xx cp xy co xz cn se aca sf acb hb bi\">\n<div class=\"zn zo zp zq zr ac gv\">\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*7D1O11im_a1kDd5OHiSRhQ.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"314\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*YURmeWFa0Zb77vmlD7qC2w.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<figcaption>Crash physically with a car, or use high velocity jets to obliterate the world</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ac cr\">\n<div class=\"hb bi hc hd he hf\">\n<p id=\"32ff\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">But the game goes one step further, it allows a self sufficient character who can travel without any vehicle.

While open spaces can be traversed in any way, most architectures come with one or two ability specific hook points. This creates a puzzle like approach to climbing and traversing massive buildings, ranging from sprouting wings and gliding, hovering on a smoke, or being a pure force of electricity. Various building and spaces demand the players to use these different abilities and their different traversal mechanics to keep variation in an otherwise monotonous task of moving between point A and

I was able to leverage Claude and build a prototype in less than a day that aggregated games news from Youtube, Twitch, and RSS feeds for video game publications (e.g. - IGN) and interperse that with content of games built on Immutable from Youtube. This allowed us to quickly test what is a healthy ratio of organic vs inorganic content and what barebones features are table stakes.</p>\n<p>Within just a day, I was able to prototype a simple web experience using javascript for frontend that leverages public APIs provided by these services. All of this was done using Claude in Cursor. I then deployed the webapp on Netlify so I could easily share it to anyone who needed to test it internally or externally.</p>\n<p>Instead of attaching screenshots, you can test the prototype yourself here<br><a href=\"https://gamerfeed.netlify.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://gamerfeed.netlify.app/</a><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n<p>GitHub repository<br><a href=\"https://github.com/bramb000/games-news-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/bramb000/games-news-feed</a></p>\n<p>Within 4 days we were able to quickly validate the requirements and scope of this project which was greatly assisted by a working, browser based prototype.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Result</h1>\n<p>The prototype did not proceed past the first few iterations as we quickly discovered the challenges of scaling it and the degree of its alignment with the company's strategy was a core prohibitve factor.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Learning</h1>\n<p>The lack of success on the project itself was far outweighed by the immense success of being able to execute concept to working prototype in hand within a day to validate at speed. This was one of my first AI assisted projects and was a core instigator of my AI adoption to increase speed 100x.

The Solution</h4>\n<p style=\"margin: 0;\"><strong>Building a responsive UI system: <em>I</em></strong> architected a technical UI system in the Snowdrop engine that scaled responsive UI across different PC monitors, TVs, tablets, and mobiles. This <strong>ensured visual parity</strong> across devices ranging from 4:3 iPads to 21:9 Ultra-wide monitors without bespoke adjustments.<br><br></p>\n<strong>Unified Interaction Matrix:</strong> Mapped divergent inputs (Keyboard, Gamepad, Touch) to singular behavioral outcomes, <strong>reducing cognitive load</strong> for users switching between platforms. This was important for Rocksmith+ as it is a Netflix style 1 subscription -&gt; multiple platform service that users interacted with over many devices.</div>\n<div><strong>Cross-Studio Ownership:</strong> Conducted design workshops between India, Japan, and the US <strong>to codify multi-platform best practices.</strong></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Context</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I joined the team in 2020 when Rocksmith+ was in pre-launch production and Ubisoft wanted a global release on mobile, PC, and next-gen game consoles (at that time, it was the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X).

closely with the UI engineers to develop a custom system</strong> where an anchor point and multiple boundary points were projected from the 2D screen into a 3D space on the screen. Once the appropriate 3D anchor points were calculated for any screen the camera adjusted in such a way that the the 3D point was placed perfectly where the 2D point was supposed to be on the screen. The result was a reactive camera system that could be configured like a 2D UI and the camera would adapt automatically.

This is mapped to a user hovering on an item to want more information via a tooltip which is common in most software and games. <br>For touch devices, we had an event when a finger was placed on an item, but did not lift it up for 600 micro seconds. This registered as a tap and hold, which was also mapped to wanting more information through a tooltip about the item. In both cases, the help tooltip was created as a hovering element next to the original element so it wasn't obscured by the cursor or the finger.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Input-System.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1016\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Input-System-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Input-System-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Input-System-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Input-System-lg.webp 1024w\">\n<figcaption>How 3 actions consistently lead to the same outcome on any platform</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>This ensured that under the hood, the technical interaction system was just as consistent as the outcomes of these interactions for the users which made it easy to maintain and scale the system rapidly as the number of screens and number of instances of a component started increasing exponentially later in development. Maintainability was greatly improved - for example, whenver the team wanted to change the time of hover or tap and hold from 600ms to 300ms for bringing up the tooltip, we would have to make the change in one place instead of maintaining two separate interaction patterns for the same outcome from a user's point of view</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"><!-- /wp:separator -->\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">The original Rocksmith+ experience was also built with only PC in mind, so a lot of the component had to undergo changes to be intuitive for mobile and console UI interactions.</span></strong></p>\n<p>For example, on a PC you would scroll through a carousel by clicking left and right arrows. You would do the same on a game console by using the bumper buttons. But on a touch device, do you remember the last time you clicked a button to scroll?

When you want to exit, you can focus on the outer container to scroll to the header of the expander and close it.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><strong>But on consoles, you cannot independently focus on a seperate item</strong>, because all directional input is mapped to the item in focus. That means regardless if you use the d-pad or either of the sticks, you can only scroll the expanded container till it is in focus and must scroll all the way up till you can reach the header to close it.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><strong>My first gut reaction was to try mapping one stick input for scrolling the container in focus and have the other stick input fixed to always scrolling the root container.</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Nested-Scroll-Solution-trial-1-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1173\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Nested-Scroll-Solution-trial-1-4-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Nested-Scroll-Solution-trial-1-4-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Nested-Scroll-Solution-trial-1-4-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Nested-Scroll-Solution-trial-1-4-lg.webp 1024w\"></figure>\n<p class=\"align-left\">This would allow users to always have a way to escape nested scroll which was a dominant interaction pattern in the product at this point of development. <strong>This solution had 2 core problems</strong> that came out from playtesting and internal reviews</p>\n<ol class=\"align-left\">\n<li><strong>This is not a natural pattern in video game menu UIs.</strong> There are no mainstream games where you can input 2 UI elements using two different sticks and this was not intuitive to users</li>\n<li><strong>One of our main goal was to let users control the UI with one hand only</strong> as the other would probably be holding a guitar. <strong>This interaction pattern required 2 hands</strong> at times</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"align-left\">For these reasons, <strong>this solution was a no-go.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">Going back to the drawing board, I drafted up 2-3 more solutions to discuss with my team. One solution proposed by the technical designers in my team was using a two axis design patterm - the vertical axis for moving between different components and the horizontal axis for accessing information of that component. <strong>I created multiple quick iterations in Figma</strong> to explore commonalities and differences between horizontal scrolls on PC, mobile, and consoles and we quickly landed at a rough solution with a horizontal scroll system at a container level which unlocked an improved, more user friendly design pattern for console and reused many components from PC/mobile.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">When looking at a song, the \"skills\" used to be in an expander as they were secondary information for mature users. <strong>The original UI had a lot more detail</strong> and through time bound, MVP-mindset development it evolved into an expander. After choosing to move away from design patterns that are unfriendly for consoles, this was the first component to get added to a horizontal scroll.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Skills-Horizontal-Scroll.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\"></figure>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><strong>The tradeoff in this particular situation was that the skills tile was streamlined and lost a lot of detail that was originally available at a single glance. Considering the ease of use for overall navigation, this tradeoff was accepted by the entire team.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">The original mockup cannot be recovered now so I have recreated a very rough version of what it used to look like from memory to give you an idea of the tradeoff.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Original-skill-tile.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"312\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Original-skill-tile-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Original-skill-tile-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Original-skill-tile-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Original-skill-tile-lg.webp 1024w\"></figure>\n<p class=\"align-left\">Once we streamlined horizontal and vertical scrolling, some action items to refine and polish were noted during playtests. One key item was when users would vertically scroll either using keyboard keys or a controller, the first item of that row's horizontal scroll would be focused by default. Because our UI was similar to Netflix in terms of volume of content, this made it very difficult to visually track the how vertical scroll reset horizontal scroll.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><strong>I worked very closely with a Senior Engineer on building a solution for consistent focusing on elements in a two axis interaction</strong> - whenever users would vertically scroll, the item closest to the current item in focus would focus. While this was relatively simple in uniform grids with, this was a little tricky in rows with non-uniform content.

A large part of team alignment came from rooting discussion in user needs and coaching the team what a truly multi device experience means which included numerous coaching and workshop sessions on mobile interactions and games. This was further challenged by language and cultural barriers in the midst of COVID-19 which meant we had to take an approach of overcommunication and actively building interpersonal relationships. While I am extremely proud of the product we put out which helps millions of humans learn guitar at their own pace at an affordable price point, I am even more proud of the team culture we built to be able to put deliver so much innovation that allowed people working on it to grow their careers and improve their skill sets.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><!-- wp:group {\"metadata\":{\"name\":\"Reviews\",\"categories\":[\"testimonials\"],\"patternName\":\"a8c/review-two-column-centered-reviews-x4\"},\"align\":\"full\",\"style\":{\"spacing\":{\"margin\":{\"top\":\"0\",\"bottom\":\"0\"},\"padding\":{\"top\":\"var:preset|spacing|50\",\"bottom\":\"var:preset|spacing|50\"},\"blockGap\":\"var:preset|spacing|50\"}},\"layout\":{\"type\":\"constrained\",\"justifyContent\":\"center\",\"wideSize\":\"900px\"}} --></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull align-left\" style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-top: var(--wp--preset--spacing--50); padding-bottom: var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);\">\n<p class=\"align-left\"><!-- wp:heading {\"textAlign\":\"center\",\"align\":\"wide\"} --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading alignwide has-text-align-center align-left\">What my colleagues from this project say about me</h2>\n<p class=\"align-left\"> </p>\n<strong><em>Hiroshi Ogawa, Lead UI Engineer, Ubisoft</em></strong><br>\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide align-left\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"padding: var(--wp--preset--spacing--10);\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\">\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><!-- /wp:group --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\",\"className\":\"is-testimonial-review\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center is-testimonial-review\">\"Bramha made the foundation of Multi-platform UI, which was one of the biggest challenges in the project.

--></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Being a live product, looking at data is always my first step. D1 retention indicator is a result of if the user has liked the game's core premise, if the game matches the marketing, and other visceral reactions. But <strong>D7 retention is an indicator of how much the game has captured the players attention when they are not playing to bring them back and form habits</strong>. I was clear from the start from the team - we are optimising for D7 retention and not D1 retention. This requires a more nuanced way of thinking.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>A good indicator of D1 retention is session length. Usually playing a long first session is highly indicative of perception fit - the game is offering the exact itch that the marketing said it would scratch. For D7, it's more about seeing what initial habits the players form after their first \"wow\" moment where they analyse the game more critically beyond the pure fun and see if a game fits their lifestyle through meta features like progression, matchmaking, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>A good metric to track habit formation is sessions per day in the first seven days</strong>, where 1 session per day means users are playing the game at least 1 time per day.  By writing SQL to query our database in BigQuery, I could derive that <strong>the average session per day for new players who downloaded the game in the last 90 days was 1.3</strong>. While that sounds great, <strong>I trusted my instinct and background in statistics to look into the distribution of this number as averages can often be deceiving.</strong></p>\n<p>What was surprising was that we had K shaped behaviour, <strong>the players who retained were playing so much that pulled the average up</strong> and practically blindsided the team.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/k-shape-problem.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"552\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/k-shape-problem-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/k-shape-problem-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/k-shape-problem-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/k-shape-problem-lg.webp 1024w\"></figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:image {\"id\":84,\"width\":\"561px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In nerd terms, this is a bimodal distribution and very few players are actually having the \"average\" experience, and those below the average where definitely not sticking around and retaining, which was a clear indicator why having 1.3 sessions per day still resulted in such poor D7 retention.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:details --></p>\n<details class=\"wp-block-details\" open=\"open\">\n<summary>Read more about the nitty gritty math</summary>\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"placeholder\":\"Type / to add a hidden block\"} --></details>\n<p>I ran a logistic regression test on D7 retention as the dependent binary variable and sessions per day as the independent continuous variable. Basically, I want to see how much session/day explain D7 retention as these are session per day till the 6th day. Turns out it explained 24% of the variance in a complex model like retention.</p>\n<p>The tl;dr of this table is that every 1 unit increase in average sessions/day would increase probability of player retaining to day 7 by 16%. This definitely proves that something about logging in everyday made players retain to D7. Pretty obvious when you say it out aloud but this let me put together a clear case to convince my team's Executive Producer as to why we should prioritise this project and the estimated impact of this project.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:table --></p>\n<figure>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Metric</td>\n<td>Coefficient (β)</td>\n<td>Odds Ratio (Exp(β))</td>\n<td>T-Statistic</td>\n<td>DF LPM R-Squared</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intercept (β₀)</td>\n<td>0.003337018482</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Independent Var (β₁)</td>\n<td>0.150119959</td>\n<td>1.161973624</td>\n<td>98.7768532830634</td>\n<td>0.2415612125</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In a world where I had more time, I would have loved to create a multivariable regression model exploring the relationship of D7 retention to session per day, session length (how long did you play each time), activation days (number of unique days played), activation days density (did you play a lot at the start or evenly spread), and game inventory linked to account level i.e. did player progress enough or feel accomplished enough to want to return the next day. Alas, for another day.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- /wp:details --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The averages are different and it explains correlation. But <strong>how do I know if the problem is with session per day and not with overall ability of the game to delight? If that were true, we would see very low engagement in the first session</strong> - but the opposite was true with a healthy average 25 minutes first session length. The game had a healthy D1 retention compared to industry benchmarks which means that it was making an impression, just <strong>failing to hook players into coming back and forming habits</strong>.</p>\n<p>Proceeding with this investigation - in Guild of Guardians, you get gold and other resources for playing. And you can use those resources to get powerful heroes, stronger swords, and sturdier shields to defeat bigger monsters. What's the catch? <strong>If you don't login in enough times</strong>, you can get as much gold as you're supposed to. So <strong>you're weaker</strong>, the boss is more difficult because your weapons are weaker. This perfectly <strong>aligned with the original observation that users were logging in less than once per daily were failing to defeat specific bosses and dungeons</strong>.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>To make certain that I was chasing the correct lead, I ran a survey to understand the user stories behind the data.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:image {\"id\":87,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-image-87 post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Discord-Question.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-lg.webp 1024w\"></figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>And came in hundreds of responses</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:image {\"id\":89,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-image-89 post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Discord-responses-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-lg.webp 1024w\"></figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:image {\"id\":90,\"width\":\"607px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized wp-image-90 post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 900px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Discord-Responses.png\" alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-lg.webp 1024w\"></figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Insight 1</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong>There was a question about when in the day do users play the game.

And when they come back, the new session will begin with a moment of delight. After a workshop sessions to let everyone have input and provide feedback and a technical review, we aligned on the specific version of our feature.</p>\n<p>After <strong>the team agreed on the new user flow and the end goal of this design</strong>, I had to create 3 new UI components - A button on the main menu for this new feature, a screen for the new feature, and the tutorial for the new feature.</p>\n<p><strong>I set out to mock up the new user flow with a combinations of existing and new screens in Figma to be able to map out how much new UI work was needed.</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Figma-User-Flow-Rough.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"434\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-Rough-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-Rough-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-Rough-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-Rough-lg.webp 1024w\">\n<figcaption>Mocking up a super quick user flow with greybox wireframes to validate the hypothesis</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>My process starts with a brain dump and creating 5-6 quick sketches of a layout.

The progression worked in such a way that players would unlock a weapon to create excitement, but by the time they collected all the gold to acquire that weapon, they would also simultaneously unlock the next sword. This dampened the excitement of the reward they just received in the form of the sword, and every milestone went from being an opportunity to celebrate to a moment of setting a new goal without acknowledgement. <br><br>The simplest fix was restructuring the existing progression in such a way that players would get all the gold required to unlock a sword over time, and they would unlock the new sword more or less around the time they got all the required gold. This created a satisfying moment upon return where players would get a sword after progressing through the campaign and immediately get to use it to kill stronger enemies. This was a pretty invisible and not related to the UI - but a highly impactful and under the hood change that made a world of difference. I need to be extra careful with this particular change as I did not want to give the player too many rewards and cannibalise monetisation.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: inherit;\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/IMG_0495.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"419\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-lg.webp 1024w\">\n<figcaption>User experience is a lot about feelings and sometimes those feelings are beyond the influence of pure visual design.

--></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Being a live product, looking at data is always my first step. D1 retention indicator is a result of if the user has liked the game's core premise, if the game matches the marketing, and other visceral reactions. But <strong>D7 retention is an indicator of how much the game has captured the players attention when they are not playing to bring them back and form habits</strong>. I was clear from the start from the team - we are optimising for D7 retention and not D1 retention. This requires a more nuanced way of thinking.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>A good indicator of D1 retention is session length. Usually playing a long first session is highly indicative of perception fit - the game is offering the exact itch that the marketing said it would scratch. For D7, it's more about seeing what initial habits the players form after their first \"wow\" moment where they analyse the game more critically beyond the pure fun and see if a game fits their lifestyle through meta features like progression, matchmaking, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>A good metric to track habit formation is sessions per day in the first seven days</strong>, where 1 session per day means users are playing the game at least 1 time per day.  By writing SQL to query our database in BigQuery, I could derive that <strong>the average session per day for new players who downloaded the game in the last 90 days was 1.3</strong>. While that sounds great, <strong>I trusted my instinct and background in statistics to look into the distribution of this number as averages can often be deceiving.</strong></p>\n<p>What was surprising was that we had K shaped behaviour, <strong>the players who retained were playing so much that pulled the average up</strong> and practically blindsided the team.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/k-shape-problem.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"552\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/k-shape-problem-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/k-shape-problem-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/k-shape-problem-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/k-shape-problem-lg.webp 1024w\"></figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:image {\"id\":84,\"width\":\"561px\",\"height\":\"auto\",\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In nerd terms, this is a bimodal distribution and very few players are actually having the \"average\" experience, and those below the average where definitely not sticking around and retaining, which was a clear indicator why having 1.3 sessions per day still resulted in such poor D7 retention.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:details --></p>\n<details class=\"wp-block-details\" open=\"open\">\n<summary>Read more about the nitty gritty math</summary>\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"placeholder\":\"Type / to add a hidden block\"} --></details>\n<p>I ran a logistic regression test on D7 retention as the dependent binary variable and sessions per day as the independent continuous variable. Basically, I want to see how much session/day explain D7 retention as these are session per day till the 6th day. Turns out it explained 24% of the variance in a complex model like retention.</p>\n<p>The tl;dr of this table is that every 1 unit increase in average sessions/day would increase probability of player retaining to day 7 by 16%. This definitely proves that something about logging in everyday made players retain to D7. Pretty obvious when you say it out aloud but this let me put together a clear case to convince my team's Executive Producer as to why we should prioritise this project and the estimated impact of this project.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:table --></p>\n<figure>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Metric</td>\n<td>Coefficient (β)</td>\n<td>Odds Ratio (Exp(β))</td>\n<td>T-Statistic</td>\n<td>DF LPM R-Squared</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intercept (β₀)</td>\n<td>0.003337018482</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Independent Var (β₁)</td>\n<td>0.150119959</td>\n<td>1.161973624</td>\n<td>98.7768532830634</td>\n<td>0.2415612125</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In a world where I had more time, I would have loved to create a multivariable regression model exploring the relationship of D7 retention to session per day, session length (how long did you play each time), activation days (number of unique days played), activation days density (did you play a lot at the start or evenly spread), and game inventory linked to account level i.e. did player progress enough or feel accomplished enough to want to return the next day. Alas, for another day.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- /wp:details --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The averages are different and it explains correlation. But <strong>how do I know if the problem is with session per day and not with overall ability of the game to delight? If that were true, we would see very low engagement in the first session</strong> - but the opposite was true with a healthy average 25 minutes first session length. The game had a healthy D1 retention compared to industry benchmarks which means that it was making an impression, just <strong>failing to hook players into coming back and forming habits</strong>.</p>\n<p>Proceeding with this investigation - in Guild of Guardians, you get gold and other resources for playing. And you can use those resources to get powerful heroes, stronger swords, and sturdier shields to defeat bigger monsters. What's the catch? <strong>If you don't login in enough times</strong>, you can get as much gold as you're supposed to.

It was clear that changes had to be made to the core progression and reward system to move the needle sizeably.</p>\n<p><strong>My proposal to the team was to reposition the current energy system into an AFK (away from keyboard)</strong> reward system that collects resources while the user is away from the game. This means that when they are ready to leave the game, we can <strong>seed the anticipation by telling users that they will have rewards waiting for them to turn negative loss aversion into positive anticipation</strong>. And when they come back, the new session will begin with a moment of delight. After a workshop sessions to let everyone have input and provide feedback and a technical review, we aligned on the specific version of our feature.</p>\n<p>After <strong>the team agreed on the new user flow and the end goal of this design</strong>, I had to create 3 new UI components - A button on the main menu for this new feature, a screen for the new feature, and the tutorial for the new feature.</p>\n<p><strong>I set out to mock up the new user flow with a combinations of existing and new screens in Figma to be able to map out how much new UI work was needed.</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Figma-User-Flow-Rough.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"434\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-Rough-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-Rough-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-Rough-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-Rough-lg.webp 1024w\">\n<figcaption>Mocking up a super quick user flow with greybox wireframes to validate the hypothesis</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>My process starts with a brain dump and creating 5-6 quick sketches of a layout.

During internal testing with external team members, we also found out this lesson had a 100% memorisation rate, that means all of our participants of the playtest could remember the action 24 hours after the tutorial. </p>\n<p>I asked the community manager to keep a specific eye on complaints about this issue either via posts or support tickets and closely monitored data to see if players were stuck at this stage.

With so few players seeing this screen, I could not justify the ROI of spending lots of effort to develop and implement animations</strong> and encourage the artist to stop at static design.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"413\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_-lg.webp 1024w\">\n<figcaption>After - An exit screen that creates a timeline and clear goal for return time</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>This was the final mocked up user flow in an interactable Figma prototype.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Figma-User-Flow-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"844\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-2-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-User-Flow-2-lg.webp 1024w\">\n<figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><span style=\"color: #838383;\"><em><!-- /wp:paragraph --></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: inherit;\">Beyond just the UI and the visual user flow, there was a flaw in the progression design that would lead to an overall poor experience. The progression worked in such a way that players would unlock a weapon to create excitement, but by the time they collected all the gold to acquire that weapon, they would also simultaneously unlock the next sword. This dampened the excitement of the reward they just received in the form of the sword, and every milestone went from being an opportunity to celebrate to a moment of setting a new goal without acknowledgement. <br><br>The simplest fix was restructuring the existing progression in such a way that players would get all the gold required to unlock a sword over time, and they would unlock the new sword more or less around the time they got all the required gold. This created a satisfying moment upon return where players would get a sword after progressing through the campaign and immediately get to use it to kill stronger enemies. This was a pretty invisible and not related to the UI - but a highly impactful and under the hood change that made a world of difference. I need to be extra careful with this particular change as I did not want to give the player too many rewards and cannibalise monetisation.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: inherit;\" src=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/IMG_0495.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"419\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-xs.webp 300w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-sm.webp 480w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-md.webp 768w ,https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-lg.webp 1024w\">\n<figcaption>User experience is a lot about feelings and sometimes those feelings are beyond the influence of pure visual design.

I rejected this in an internal review as the moment of delight felt more like a sales offer from the get go than an additional benefit to a celebration.

After all, they don't want to play a video game that could have just been a spreadsheet.

What this means was that we no longer had a k-shaped behaviour where the most engaged players were playing so much that it pulled the average up and gave us the wrong impression of the game.</p>\n<p>If you remember the initial data point that I looked at the beginning, the inference of the logistic regression model was that there is a 16% higher likelihood of users engaging if their sessions per day increased by 1 unit.
