The first piece of work started with lots of user testing where I requested internal and external volunteers to play a crude, ported version of the PC version of their game on their mobile and tablet without any scaling and no interactions except simple taps.

For that, I worked very closely with the UI engineers to develop a system where an anchor point and multiple boundary points were projected from the 2D screen into a 3D space on the screen. Once the appropriate 3D anchor points were calculated for any screen the camera adjusted in such a way that the the 3D point was placed perfectly where the 2D point was supposed to be on the screen. The result was a reactive camera system that could be configured like a 2D UI and the camera would adapt automatically. Basically, it meant that 3D elements could be designed and treated as 2D elements in the UI.</p><p>It would automatically know how much to zoom in or out and how to move left and right to make sure all the 3D objects appeared at the correct places on the screen no matter the aspect ratio and screen resolution of the device, whether it was a nearly square ipad or a really wide phone. The MVP of this solution achieved usable display results on over 8 types of aspect ratios and different devices which broadly encompassed 90% of the devices or screens we expected the app to be used on out of the box.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center" data-publii-token="publii-1765863682621-qfqlau"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/IMG_0508.PNG" alt="A diagram explaining how 3D coordinates are converted to 2D UI which is then used to control a 3D object like 2D UI element" width="900" height="872" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0508-xs.PNG 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0508-sm.PNG 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0508-md.PNG 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0508-lg.PNG 1024w"></figure><figcaption>Converting a 3D object into 2D coordinates, then applying responsive UI component rules to the 3D object, and then making the 3D object adjust by moving or zooming in and out to adjust to the new 2D coordinates on a different screen</figcaption></figure><p>Here is the fundamental difference of how the UI with 3D objects are treated in Rocksmith+ compared to most other games (Call of Duty mobile used an example here)</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Frame-7.png" alt="" width="900" height="540" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Frame-7-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Frame-7-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Frame-7-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Frame-7-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>You can see the overlap between the 2D and 3D elements when the screen becomes narrower, like on an ipad.

You would do the same on a game console by using the bumper buttons. But on a touch device, do you remember the last time you clicked a button to scroll? Instead you will see your feed extends beyond the screen, and you simply scroll to access those items outside the screen.

The distance between user and device heavily changed based on whether they were advanced guitar players or beginners, whether they played easy or difficult songs, whether they played bass or guitar, whether they played a full 34" bass or some other size, or if they played different guitars, whether they had equipment such as pedals, amps, or headphones attached. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/IMG-20251109-WA0022.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="274" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG-20251109-WA0022-xs.jpg 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG-20251109-WA0022-sm.jpg 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG-20251109-WA0022-md.jpg 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG-20251109-WA0022-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure><div class="wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid column1-desktop-grid__span-6 column1-desktop-grid__row-1 column2-desktop-grid__span-6 column2-desktop-grid__start-7 column2-desktop-grid__row-1 column1-tablet-grid__span-4 column1-tablet-grid__row-1 column2-tablet-grid__span-4 column2-tablet-grid__start-5 column2-tablet-grid__row-1 column1-mobile-grid__span-4 column1-mobile-grid__row-1 column2-mobile-grid__span-4 column2-mobile-grid__row-2"><p></p><p></p><p></p></div><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid column1-desktop-grid__span-6 column1-desktop-grid__row-1 column2-desktop-grid__span-6 column2-desktop-grid__start-7 column2-desktop-grid__row-1 column1-tablet-grid__span-4 column1-tablet-grid__row-1 column2-tablet-grid__span-4 column2-tablet-grid__start-5 column2-tablet-grid__row-1 column1-mobile-grid__span-4 column1-mobile-grid__row-1 column2-mobile-grid__span-4 column2-mobile-grid__row-2"><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid-column wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid__padding-none"><p></p><div class="gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--wide"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0023.jpg" data-size="1600x746"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0023-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0017.jpg" data-size="2048x955"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0017-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0024.jpg" data-size="1600x746"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0024-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0018.jpg" data-size="2048x955"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0018-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a></figure></div></div><p></p></div><p></p></div><p></p><p></p><p>This customisation system was easy to build as we had already worked on a dynamic system to make our 3D UI responsive (as you may have read above).

Since their minds were occupied with guitar chords and memorising other complex techniques, it made no sense to add the cognitive load of also learning how to interact with this app on multiple platforms.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/IMG_0492.png" alt="" width="560" height="289" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0492-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0492-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0492-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0492-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>The user knows what they want, but how do they recreate it on a different platform?</figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p><p>The first version of a unified interaction system was an interaction matrix for achieving the most important outcomes.</p><p></p><p></p><figure>I created a 3 dimensional interaction matrix that mapped outcome to a component to an action on platform and conducted many surveys to create an exhaustive list of what are the most commonly mapped translations between interactions.</figure><figure>For example, hovering with a mouse cursor on desktop was majorly translated as touch and hold for users across various languages and countries, and while "hover" was the same on console it was from using the d-pad to navigate to the option as opposed to a freeform cursor.</figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Interaction-Matrix-Abstraction.png" alt="" width="900" height="148" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Interaction-Matrix-Abstraction-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Interaction-Matrix-Abstraction-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Interaction-Matrix-Abstraction-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Interaction-Matrix-Abstraction-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>This is a sample abstraction of a complex interaction matrixaption</figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Once I had collected an exhaustive list of what users commonly mapped various interactions on various platforms to specific outcomes, I made sure to map the mechanics of a device with each other to build a cohesive system so figure out how to unify them in in terms of implementation.</p><p>For example, on PC, there is a UI event called hover which is activated when a cursor enters a region and does not exit the area or make an action like a click for 600 micro seconds. This is mapped to a user hovering on an item to want more information via a tooltip which is common in most software and games.<br>For touch devices, we had an event when a finger was placed on an item, but did not lift it up for 600 micro seconds. This registered as a tap and hold, which was also mapped to wanting more information through a tooltip about the item. In both cases, the help tooltip was created as a hovering element next to the original element so it wasn't obscured by the cursor or the finger.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Input-System.png" alt="" width="900" height="1016" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Input-System-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Input-System-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Input-System-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Input-System-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>How 3 actions consistently lead to the same outcome on any platform</figcaption><p>This ensured that under the hood, the technical interaction system was just as consistent as the outcomes of these interactions for the users which made it easy to maintain and scale the system rapidly as the number of screens and number of instances of a component started increasing exponentially later in development. Maintainability was greatly improved - for example, whenver the team wanted to change the time of hover or tap and hold from 600ms to 300ms for bringing up the tooltip, we would have to make the change in one place instead of maintaining two separate interaction patterns for the same outcome from a user's point of view</p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"><p></p><h1>Result</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Rocksmith+ launched in open beta and swiftly followed a global launch in 2022.

A large part of team alignment came from rooting discussion in user needs and coaching the team what a truly multi device experience means which included numerous coaching and workshop sessions on mobile interactions and games. This was further challenged by language and cultural barriers in the midst of COVID 19 which meant we had to take an approach of overcommunication and actively building interpersonal relationships. While I am extremely proud of the product we put out which helps millions of humans learn guitar at their own pace at an affordable price point, I am even more proud of the team culture we built to be able to put deliver so much innovation that allowed people working on it to grow their careers and improve their skill sets.</p><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-group alignfull" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-top: var(--wp--preset--spacing--50); padding-bottom: var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);"><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading alignwide has-text-align-center">What my colleagues from this project say about me</h2><p> </p><strong><em>Hiroshi Ogawa, Lead UI Engineer, Ubisoft</em></strong><br><div class="wp-block-columns alignwide"><div class="wp-block-column" style="padding: var(--wp--preset--spacing--10);"><div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group"><p></p></div><blockquote><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center is-testimonial-review">"Bramha made the foundation of Multi-platform UI, which was one of the biggest challenges in the project.
