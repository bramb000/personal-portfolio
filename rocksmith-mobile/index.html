The Solution</h4><p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Building a responsive UI system: <em>I</em></strong> architected a technical UI system in the Snowdrop engine that scaled responsive UI across different PC monitors, TVs, tablets, and mobiles. This <strong>ensured visual parity</strong> across devices ranging from 4:3 iPads to 21:9 Ultra-wide monitors without bespoke adjustments.<br><br></p><strong>Unified Interaction Matrix:</strong> Mapped divergent inputs (Keyboard, Gamepad, Touch) to singular behavioral outcomes, <strong>reducing cognitive load</strong> for users switching between platforms. This was important for Rocksmith+ as it is a Netflix style 1 subscription -&gt; multiple platform service that users interacted with over many devices.</div><div><strong>Cross-Studio Ownership:</strong> Conducted design workshops between India, Japan, and the US <strong>to codify multi-platform best practices.</strong></div></div></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Context</h2><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I joined the team in 2020 when Rocksmith+ was in pre-launch production and Ubisoft wanted a global release on mobile, PC, and next-gen game consoles (at that time, it was the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X).

their device.</strong> The distance between user and device heavily changed based on whether they were advanced guitar players or beginners, whether they played easy or difficult songs, whether they played bass or guitar, whether they played a full 34" bass or some other size, or if they played different guitars, whether they had equipment such as pedals, amps, or headphones attached. </p><figure

This is mapped to a user hovering on an item to want more information via a tooltip which is common in most software and games.<br>For touch devices, we had an event when a finger was placed on an item, but did not lift it up for 600 micro seconds. This registered as a tap and hold, which was also mapped to wanting more information through a tooltip about the item. In both cases, the help tooltip was created as a hovering element next to the original element so it wasn't obscured by the cursor or the finger.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Input-System.png" alt="" width="900" height="1016" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Input-System-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Input-System-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Input-System-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Input-System-lg.webp 1024w"><figcaption>How 3 actions consistently lead to the same outcome on any platform</figcaption></figure><p>This ensured that under the hood, the technical interaction system was just as consistent as the outcomes of these interactions for the users which made it easy to maintain and scale the system rapidly as the number of screens and number of instances of a component started increasing exponentially later in development. Maintainability was greatly improved - for example, whenver the team wanted to change the time of hover or tap and hold from 600ms to 300ms for bringing up the tooltip, we would have to make the change in one place instead of maintaining two separate interaction patterns for the same outcome from a user's point of view</p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"><p></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: inherit;">The original Rocksmith+ experience was also built with only PC in mind, so a lot of the component had to undergo changes to be intuitive for mobile and console UI interactions.</span></strong></p><p>For example, on a PC you would scroll through a carousel by clicking left and right arrows. You would do the same on a game console by using the bumper buttons. But on a touch device, do you remember the last time you clicked a button to scroll? Instead you will see your feed extends beyond the screen, and you simply scroll to access those items outside the screen. The UI is built to lead to and teach these natural behaviours that Rocksmith's prototype version was missing as it was built PC first.</p><p>A <strong>large part of my role was making all these small changes to the global design system and its component libraries to improve intuitiveness on mobile, PC, and consoles.</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/mobile-componenet-R-2.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="380" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/mobile-componenet-R-2-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/mobile-componenet-R-2-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/mobile-componenet-R-2-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/mobile-componenet-R-2-lg.webp 1024w"><figcaption>Touch focused UI rarely has arrows to scroll, usually the extends just a little bit off screen to hint that the item can be scrolled by physically pulling the item onto the screenl</figcaption></figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/RPCInteractions-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif" alt="" width="900" height="506"><figcaption>On PC, carousel carets are critical for horizontal scrolling with a mouse that usually only supports vertical scroll.

One key item was when users would vertically scroll either using keyboard keys or a controller, the first item of that row's horizontal scroll would be focused by default. Because our UI was similar to Netflix in terms of volume of content, this made it very difficult to visually track the how vertical scroll reset horizontal scroll.</p><p class="align-left"><strong>I worked very closely with a Senior Engineer on building a solution for consistent focusing on elements in a two axis interaction</strong> - whenever users would vertically scroll, the item closest to the current item in focus would focus. While this was relatively simple in uniform grids with, this was a little tricky in rows with non-uniform content. For this, we used approximation based on how many spots in a horizontal grid an element took.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/R-scroll-ambiguity.png" alt="" width="900" height="489" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/R-scroll-ambiguity-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/R-scroll-ambiguity-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/R-scroll-ambiguity-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/R-scroll-ambiguity-lg.webp 1024w"><figcaption>When you scroll up from here, what item do you expect to focus on?</figcaption></figure><p class="align-left">For example, if you are focused on tile number 3 in row 3, and move to row 4, it's simply focusing on tile number 3 in row 4 as well.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/R-Vertical-scroll.gif" alt="" width="900" height="506"></figure><p class="align-left">But when scrolling from point A to point B in an irregular grid, it was difficult to predict the user intent.
