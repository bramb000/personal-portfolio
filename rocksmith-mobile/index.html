For that, I worked very closely with the UI engineers to develop a system where an anchor point was projected from the 3D dimension space into a 2D space on the screen, and the anchor point was then subjected to laws of bounds. Once the appropriate 2D anchor point was calculated for any screen, the camera adjusted in such a way that the 3D projection of it aligned as closely as possible. The result was a reactive camera system that could be configured like a 2D UI and the camera would adapt automatically. It would automatically know how much to zoom in or out and how to move left and right to make sure all the 3D objects appeared at the correct places on the screen no matter the aspect ratio and screen resolution of the device, whether it was a nearly square Ipad or a really tall phone. The MVP of this solution achieved usable display results on over 8 types of aspect ratios and different devices which broadly encompassed 90% of the devices or screens we expected the app to be used on</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/unnamed-2.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="274" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/unnamed-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/unnamed-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/unnamed-2-md.jpg 768w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/unnamed-2-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid column1-desktop-grid__span-6 column1-desktop-grid__row-1 column2-desktop-grid__span-6 column2-desktop-grid__start-7 column2-desktop-grid__row-1 column1-tablet-grid__span-4 column1-tablet-grid__row-1 column2-tablet-grid__span-4 column2-tablet-grid__start-5 column2-tablet-grid__row-1 column1-mobile-grid__span-4 column1-mobile-grid__row-1 column2-mobile-grid__span-4 column2-mobile-grid__row-2"><p></p><div class="wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid-column wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid__padding-none"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/IMG_0459.png" alt="" width="366" height="274" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0459-xs.png 300w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0459-sm.png 480w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0459-md.png 768w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0459-lg.png 1024w"></figure></div><p></p><p></p><div class="align-center">Ipad Pro 13"</div><div class="wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid-column wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid__padding-none"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/IMG-20251109-WA0017.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="274" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG-20251109-WA0017-xs.jpg 300w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG-20251109-WA0017-sm.jpg 480w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG-20251109-WA0017-md.jpg 768w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG-20251109-WA0017-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure></div><p></p></div><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid column1-desktop-grid__span-6 column1-desktop-grid__row-1 column2-desktop-grid__span-6 column2-desktop-grid__start-7 column2-desktop-grid__row-1 column1-tablet-grid__span-4 column1-tablet-grid__row-1 column2-tablet-grid__span-4 column2-tablet-grid__start-5 column2-tablet-grid__row-1 column1-mobile-grid__span-4 column1-mobile-grid__row-1 column2-mobile-grid__span-4 column2-mobile-grid__row-2"><p></p><div class="wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid-column wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid__padding-none align-center"><p></p>Samsung Galaxy Phone 6.3"<p></p></div><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid-column wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid__padding-none"><span style="font-size: inherit;">The original Rocksmith+ experience was also built with only PC in mind, so a lot of the component had to undergo changes to be intuitive for mobile devices.</span></div></div><p></p><p></p><p>For example, on a PC you would scroll through a carousel by clicking left and right arrows. You would do the same on a game console by using the bumper buttons. But on a touch device, do you remember the last time you clicked a button to scroll? Instead you will see your feed extends beyond the screen, and you simply scroll to access those items outside the screen. The UI is built to lead to and teach these natural behaviours that Rocksmith's prototype version was missing as it was built PC first.

The distance between player and device heavily changed based on whether they were advanced guitar players or beginners, whether they played easy or difficult songs, whether they played bass or guitar, whether they played a full 34" bass or some other size, or if they played different guitars, whether they had equipment such as pedals, amps, or headphones attached. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/IMG-20251109-WA0022.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="274" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG-20251109-WA0022-xs.jpg 300w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG-20251109-WA0022-sm.jpg 480w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG-20251109-WA0022-md.jpg 768w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG-20251109-WA0022-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure><div class="wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid column1-desktop-grid__span-6 column1-desktop-grid__row-1 column2-desktop-grid__span-6 column2-desktop-grid__start-7 column2-desktop-grid__row-1 column1-tablet-grid__span-4 column1-tablet-grid__row-1 column2-tablet-grid__span-4 column2-tablet-grid__start-5 column2-tablet-grid__row-1 column1-mobile-grid__span-4 column1-mobile-grid__row-1 column2-mobile-grid__span-4 column2-mobile-grid__row-2"><p></p><p></p><p></p></div><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid column1-desktop-grid__span-6 column1-desktop-grid__row-1 column2-desktop-grid__span-6 column2-desktop-grid__start-7 column2-desktop-grid__row-1 column1-tablet-grid__span-4 column1-tablet-grid__row-1 column2-tablet-grid__span-4 column2-tablet-grid__start-5 column2-tablet-grid__row-1 column1-mobile-grid__span-4 column1-mobile-grid__row-1 column2-mobile-grid__span-4 column2-mobile-grid__row-2"><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid-column wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid__padding-none"><p></p><div class="gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--wide"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0023.jpg" data-size="1600x746"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0023-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0017.jpg" data-size="2048x955"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0017-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0024.jpg" data-size="1600x746"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0024-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0018.jpg" data-size="2048x955"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG-20251109-WA0018-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a></figure></div></div><figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large"><figure class="wp-image-128"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/img-20251109-wa0014-1.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/img-20251109-wa0014-1-xs.jpg 300w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/img-20251109-wa0014-1-sm.jpg 480w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/img-20251109-wa0014-1-md.jpg 768w, https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/img-20251109-wa0014-1-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure></figure><p></p></div><p></p></div><p></p><p></p><p>This customisation system was easy to build as we had already worked on a dynamic system to make our 3D UI responsive. The original system, being built on solid technical foundations, meant that users could change their configuration at run time meaning they could change whenever they wanted and however many times they wanted.</p><p></p><p></p><p>One of the final pieces was how players interact with the UI. Some players could be on a chair using a keyboard, some could be on a couch with a PS5 controller in one hand and a guitar in another, and some could be leaning over a stool to touch a tablet screen on their kitchen table. The environments and context ranged on a wide spectrum.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This is why we needed a consistent interaction system so outcomes could result from the same user actions over and over again. Since their minds and memories were occupied with guitar chords and other complex techniques, it made no sense to burden them needing to learn how to operate this UI.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The first version of a unified interaction system was an interaction matrix for achieving the most important outcomes</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout align-center" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 90%; height: 1190px;"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 19.4435%;">Outcome -&gt;</td><td style="width: 18.2748%;">Input (Confirmation, Cancellation, Selection)</td><td style="width: 15.7248%;">See More in a Scroll Group</td><td style="width: 15.2998%;">Get more information</td><td style="width: 17.106%;">Return to previous state (Not confirmation)</td><td style="width: 14.2373%;"><em>more actions.....</em></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 19.4435%;">Component ↓</td><td style="width: 18.2748%;"> </td><td style="width: 15.7248%;"> </td><td style="width: 15.2998%;"> </td><td style="width: 17.106%;"> </td><td style="width: 14.2373%;"> </td></tr><tr><td style="width: 19.4435%;">Button</td><td style="width: 18.2748%;">Left Mouse Click or Enter Key (PC)<br>Single Tap (Mobile)<br>Press (A) or (X) (Game Consoles)</td><td style="width: 15.7248%;"> </td><td style="width: 15.2998%;"> </td><td style="width: 17.106%;"> </td><td style="width: 14.2373%;"> </td></tr><tr><td style="width: 19.4435%;">Information Tooltip</td><td style="width: 18.2748%;"> </td><td style="width: 15.7248%;">Mouse Wheel Scroll (PC)<br>Scroll With Finger (Mobile)<br>Highlight Out of Screen Component (Game Console)</td><td style="width: 15.2998%;">Cursor Hover (PC)<br>Tap and hold (Mobile)<br>Highlight (Game Consoles)</td><td style="width: 17.106%;">Escape hover region (PC)<br>Leave hold (Mobile)<br>Press</td><td style="width: 14.2373%;"> </td></tr><tr><td style="width: 19.4435%;">Content Card</td><td style="width: 18.2748%;">Left Mouse Click or Enter Key (PC)<br>Single Tap (Mobile)<br>Press (A) or (X) (Game Consoles)</td><td style="width: 15.7248%;">Mouse Wheel Scroll (PC)<br>Scroll With Finger (Mobile)<br>Highlight Out of Screen Component (Game Console)</td><td style="width: 15.2998%;">Cursor Hover (PC)<br>Tap and hold (Mobile)<br>Highlight (Game Consoles)</td><td style="width: 17.106%;">Escape Key or Click Close (PC)<br>Tap Close (Mobile)<br>Press (B) or (O) (Game Console)</td><td style="width: 14.2373%;"> </td></tr><tr><td style="width: 19.4435%;"><em>more components.....</em></td><td style="width: 18.2748%;"> </td><td style="width: 15.7248%;"> </td><td style="width: 15.2998%;"> </td><td style="width: 17.106%;"> </td><td style="width: 14.2373%;"> </td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is a sample abstraction of a complex interaction matrix</figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Once we had a consistent mapping between common outcomes that users wanted and consistent mapping the same actions to them, we then made sure to map the mechanics of a device with each other to build a cohesive system that is technically sound. For example, on PC, there is a UI event called hover which is activated when a cursor enters a region and does not exit the area or make an action like a click for 600 micro seconds. This is mapped to a player hovering on an item to want more information which is common in most digital applications. For touch devices, we had an event a finger was placed on an item, but did not lift it up for 600 micro seconds. This registered as a tap and hold, which was also mapped to wanting "more information" about the item the player tapped and held. In both cases, the help tooltip was created as a hovering element next to the original element so it wasn't obscured by the cursor or the finger. This ensured that under the hood, the technical interaction system was just as consistent as the outcomes of these interactions for the users which made it easy to maintain and scale the system rapidly as the number of screens and number of instances of a component started increasing exponentially later in development.</p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"><p></p><h1>Result</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Rocksmith+ launched in open beta and swiftly followed a global launch in 2022.

A large part of team alignment came from rooting discussion in user needs and coaching the team what a truly multi device experience means which included numerous coaching and workshop sessions on mobile interactions and games. This was further challenged by language and cultural barriers during COVID 19, and meant we had to take an approach of overcommunication and active building of interpersonal relationships. While I am extremely proud of the product we put out, which helps millions of humans learn guitar at their own pace at an affordable price point, I am even more proud of the team culture we built.</p><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-group alignfull" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-top: var(--wp--preset--spacing--50); padding-bottom: var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);"><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading alignwide has-text-align-center">What my colleagues say about me</h2><p> </p><strong><em>Hiroshi Ogawa, Lead UI Engineer, Ubisoft</em></strong><br><div class="wp-block-columns alignwide"><div class="wp-block-column" style="padding: var(--wp--preset--spacing--10);"><div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group"><p></p></div><blockquote><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center is-testimonial-review">"Bramha made the foundation of Multi-platform UI, which was one of the biggest challenges in the project.
