The Problem</h4><p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Fragmentation:</strong> Rocksmith+ faced a massive scaling challenge: launching a PC-first MVP on Mobile and Console simultaneously. Without a unified framework, the team faced tripled maintenance costs and a siloed UX that failed to respect the varying environmental contexts of guitar learners.</p></div><div><h4 style="margin: 0 0 8px 0; font-size: 0.9rem; text-transform: uppercase; color: #d32f2f; letter-spacing: 0.1em;">02. The Solution</h4><p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Building a responsive UI system: </strong>I architected a technical UI system in the Snowdrop engine that scaled responsive UI across different PC monitors, TVs, tablets, and mobiles. This <strong>ensured visual parity</strong> across devices ranging from 4:3 iPads to 21:9 Ultra-wide monitors without bespoke adjustments.<br><br></p><strong>Unified Input Philosophy:</strong> Mapped divergent inputs (Keyboard, Gamepad, Touch) to singular behavioral outcomes, <strong>reducing cognitive load</strong> for users switching between platforms. This was important for Rocksmith+ as it is a Netflix style 1 subscription = multiple platform service that users interacted with over many devices.</div><div><strong>Driving Global Collaboration:</strong> Orchestrated design collaboration between India, Japan, and the US <strong>to share user insights and create a holistic understanding of user needs across all platforms.</strong></div><div><strong>Adding millions of new users to Rocksmith:</strong></div><div>This was the traditional Rocksmith experience - on a big screen with lots of space with no choice except an expensive desktop or a game console.</div><div><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/traditional-rocksmith.webp" alt="" width="900" height="338" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/traditional-rocksmith-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/traditional-rocksmith-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/traditional-rocksmith-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/traditional-rocksmith-lg.webp 1024w"><figcaption>The traditional Rocksmith experience was always on a big screen</figcaption></figure><p>Rocksmith+ gave users the options to learn guitar anywhere they wanted, on any device they wanted with 1 subsrciption.

Maintainability was greatly improved - for example, whenver the team wanted to change the time of hover or tap and hold from 600ms to 300ms for bringing up the tooltip, we would have to make the change in one place instead of maintaining two separate interaction patterns for the same outcome from a user's point of view</p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"><p></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: inherit;">The original Rocksmith+ experience was also built with only PC in mind, so a lot of the component had to undergo changes to be intuitive for mobile and console UI interactions.</span></strong></p><p>For example, on a PC you would scroll through a carousel by clicking left and right arrows. You would do the same on a game console by using the bumper buttons. But on a touch device, do you remember the last time you clicked a button to scroll? Instead you will see your feed extends beyond the screen, and you simply scroll to access those items outside the screen. The UI is built to lead to and teach these natural behaviours that Rocksmith's prototype version was missing as it was built PC first.</p><p>A <strong>large part of my role was making all these small changes to the global design system and its component libraries to improve intuitiveness on mobile, PC, and consoles.</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/mobile-componenet-R-2.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="380" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/mobile-componenet-R-2-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/mobile-componenet-R-2-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/mobile-componenet-R-2-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/mobile-componenet-R-2-lg.webp 1024w"><figcaption>Touch focused UI rarely has arrows to scroll, usually the extends just a little bit off screen to hint that the item can be scrolled by physically pulling the item onto the screenl</figcaption></figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/RPCInteractions-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif" alt="" width="900" height="506"><figcaption>On PC, carousel carets are critical for horizontal scrolling with a mouse that usually only supports vertical scroll.

While this is a common design pattern for Desktop where users have a mouse and on mobile where users can touch, on consoles it created a major issue.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Nested-Scroll-4.png" alt="" width="900" height="969" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Nested-Scroll-4-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Nested-Scroll-4-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Nested-Scroll-4-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Nested-Scroll-4-lg.webp 1024w"><figcaption>This is an example of a nested scroll.

That means regardless if you use the d-pad or either of the sticks, you can only scroll the expanded container till it is in focus and must scroll all the way up till you can reach the header to close it.</p><p class="align-left"><strong>My first gut reaction was to try mapping one stick input for scrolling the container in focus and have the other stick input fixed to always scrolling the root container.</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Nested-Scroll-Solution-trial-1-4.png" alt="" width="900" height="1173" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Nested-Scroll-Solution-trial-1-4-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Nested-Scroll-Solution-trial-1-4-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Nested-Scroll-Solution-trial-1-4-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Nested-Scroll-Solution-trial-1-4-lg.webp 1024w"></figure><p class="align-left">This would allow users to always have a way to escape nested scroll which was a dominant interaction pattern in the product at this point of development. <strong>This solution had 2 core problems</strong> that came out from playtesting and internal reviews</p><ol class="align-left"><li><strong>This is not a natural pattern in video game menu UIs.</strong> There are no mainstream games where you can input 2 UI elements using two different sticks and this was not intuitive to users</li><li><strong>One of our main goal was to let users control the UI with one hand only</strong> as the other would probably be holding a guitar. <strong>This interaction pattern required 2 hands</strong> at times</li></ol><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Guitar-Controller-1-2.png" alt="" width="480" height="542" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Guitar-Controller-1-2-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Guitar-Controller-1-2-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Guitar-Controller-1-2-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/Guitar-Controller-1-2-lg.webp 1024w"><figcaption>One of users had explicitly noted that they hated having to put down their guitar to use two hands for a controller.

One solution proposed by the technical designers in my team was using a two axis design patterm - the vertical axis for moving between different components and the horizontal axis for accessing information of that component. <strong>I created multiple quick iterations in Figma</strong> to explore commonalities and differences between horizontal scrolls on PC, mobile, and consoles and we quickly landed at a rough solution with a horizontal scroll system at a container level which unlocked an improved, more user friendly design pattern for console and reused many components from PC/mobile.</p><p class="align-left">When looking at a song, the "skills" used to be in an expander as they were secondary information for mature users. <strong>The original UI had a lot more detail</strong> and through time bound, MVP-mindset development it evolved into an expander. After choosing to move away from design patterns that are unfriendly for consoles, this was the first component to get added to a horizontal scroll.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/Skills-Horizontal-Scroll.gif" alt="" width="900" height="506"></figure><p class="align-left"><strong>The tradeoff in this particular situation was that the skills tile was streamlined and lost a lot of information that was originally available at a single glance. Users now had to click the tile which opened a popup with all that information. Considering the ease of use for overall navigation, this tradeoff was accepted by the entire team.</strong></p><p class="align-left">Once we streamlined horizontal and vertical scrolling, some action items to refine and polish were noted during playtests. One key item was when users would vertically scroll either using keyboard keys or a controller, the first item of that row's horizontal scroll would be focused by default. Because our UI was similar to Netflix in terms of volume of content, this made it very difficult to visually track the how vertical scroll reset horizontal scroll.</p><p class="align-left"><strong>I worked very closely with a Senior Engineer on building a solution for consistent focusing on elements in a two axis interaction</strong> - whenever users would vertically scroll, the item closest to the current item in focus would focus. While this was relatively simple in uniform grids with, this was a little tricky in rows with non-uniform content. For this, we used approximation based on how many spots in a horizontal grid an element took.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/R-scroll-ambiguity.png" alt="" width="900" height="489" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/R-scroll-ambiguity-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/R-scroll-ambiguity-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/R-scroll-ambiguity-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/responsive/R-scroll-ambiguity-lg.webp 1024w"><figcaption>When you scroll up from here, what item do you expect to focus on?</figcaption></figure><p class="align-left">For example, if you are focused on tile number 3 in row 3, and move to row 4, it's simply focusing on tile number 3 in row 4 as well.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/6/R-Vertical-scroll.gif" alt="" width="900" height="506"></figure><p class="align-left">But when scrolling from point A to point B in an irregular grid, it was difficult to predict the user intent. So I opted to rather maintain clear visual anchoring such that the item focused would be closest to the current item in focus. </p><p class="align-left">If you are focused in tile number 3 on row 2 and move to row 3 with non-uniform items, then the UI will focus on the item closest in presence of tile number 3 in that container by using tile calculation - if the item in focus is 2 items from the left anchor then move to the item closest to 2 items from the left in the next container. <strong>This solution was not completely watertight</strong> as it would have some edge cases where the horizontal scroll did not adhere to strict grid based placement. But when we specifically asked our <strong>playtest moderator to keep an eye</strong> on this issue and included a question "comparing to other main menus such as your console's game library, did you have any issues with the Rocksmith+ main menu?" with a binary yes or no answer. 100% of the results came in as "yes" and the moderator had nothing to report about the navigation.
