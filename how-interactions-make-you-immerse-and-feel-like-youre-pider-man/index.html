The increase in quality of art, level design, and visual storytelling now requires level designers to create sparse and empty locations where players can take in the beauty of the worlds they inhabit. The empty, barren spaces of Zelda: Breath of the Wild have a function in the world — to create a sense of mystery and exploration, or to simple bring some spatial serenity. The physical space of Red Dead Redemption 2 may be sparse to showcase the sense of wilderness yet untouched by civilisation, but the world is anything but sparse. Both these games are sandboxes with a highly complex ruleset in which the players can create their own joy, which is supplemented by the overarching level design of the world. Every mountain, valley, cliff, street, village, or structure can be explored. The sheer scale of the world space to accommodate all these locations, vistas, venues, and sets is tremendous, rivaling a real world experience of hiking or urban exploration.</p><p id="2c05" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">Besides the world itself, there are now many nuances to imitate real world situations — unique terrains and geological difficulties.

Arthur Morgan is a representative of the old wild cowboys- bulky physiques, laborious movement. The way he reacts to the controller lends to the fantasy, but it is simply not possible to use Arthur Morgan to traverse the wilderness of the world. Hence, the players get access to horses, coaches, and trains. All of these are built to cover vast distances and hence control much differently than Arthur.</p><p id="57a1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">Covering the huge expanse demands a lot of time being spent on horseback, yet being on horseback is not the best of Red Dead 2.

His first outing under Rocksteady was a fairly linear, stealth game called Arkham Asylum, where he took advantage of ducts and overhead vantage points. He used his grappling gun to access spaces outside human reaches, and glided across architectural gorges to reach the other side. It was believable when the game was situated in the small and tight Arkham Asylum.<br>When Batman moved on to Arkham City, it was a different story. The same grappling hook was now used to traverse across a gigantic city, the gliding was used to cover distances spanning multiple city blocks. No Batman movie or comic is dominantly about Batman covering huge distances without his Bat-mobile, yet Arkham Asylum’s most dominant activity is traversing the city to reach locations. Yes, it is more dominant that the actual stealth, the star of the gameplay. Let us analyse the 3Cs of Arkham City and understand why it is not the best example when it comes to large scale traversal.</p><p id="0b91" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="yt lr">Character</strong><br>Batman is a huge character. He is bulky, muscular, and wears a gigantic bat costume with pointy ears. He has tons of gadgets and has the grace of a monster truck (except when he is fighting). Also he is an actually huge character, taking a 3rd of the screen.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*CKM_RYQy1L4UKEe4zxmfGQ.jpeg" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Having an entire third dedicated to the character creates a sense of weight, mass, and claustrophobia</figcaption></figure><p id="b9f8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">Batman has a grappling hook that he can shoot towards a grappling point. The hooks sinks in at such a point and drags him towards it. Batman can cancel the motion at any point and drop into a free fall, but he cannot change direction.<br>He is slightly more controllable when gliding, where he can change direction and pull a few maneuvers like diving to build up momentum before unfurling his cape and gaining a lot of height. He can also shoot his grapple while gliding, and use the momentum of the grapple gun to launch himself over huge distances. The launch is a huge affordance in a city where height differences between streets and rooftops is a lot.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*VPluM2-bpamtpR4pYW94qg.gif" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>The momentum based launch is the first step to achieve any sense of momentum and verticality</figcaption></figure><p id="b09c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">Changing direction is a problem for Batman. Due to his rigid grappling hook, taking advantage of using himself as a pendulum across corners is impossible. Cornering using a mass and rope is a massive miss in a game all about ropes, mass, and grappling hooks. It constantly requires Batman to glide to navigate corners.</p><p id="f7f2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="yt lr">Controller</strong><br>Batman is pretty snappy when it comes to reacting to the controller, automatically locating and snapping to the edges of architecture. He travels mostly in straight lines and normal projectile curves when grappling. Batman actually shines when it comes to gliding as he has a much favourable sensitivity than compared to his on foot controls. It is possible to navigate tight spaces when gliding, and navigate tight vertical spaces using diving and cape lift-offs.</p><p id="4d1c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="yt lr">Camera</strong><br>Of all the 3Cs, this one is the most bland in the Arkham Games. Batman’s motion is pretty independent of the camera, but the camera is very dependent on the character. Hence it difficult to align the character to where the player wants to look, but it automatically (and sometimes frustratingly) aligns to where the character is facing. It also does not use any sleek camera tricks that are used when capturing high velocity motion.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*Scc8KravfE47fJ9sDN_iWg.gif" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>A camera that does not lend to the motion it is capturing contributes nothing</figcaption></figure><p id="e2a5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">For a game that is dominantly large scale traversal, it fails to create and sense of thrill or excitement. At most, some motion lines are present and a change of distance between the character and camera. It lacks any dramatic change in FOV to bring focus and tunnel vision, it does not have auto pans and tilts to bring a sense of verticality, and lack dynamic distance change to bring a sense of acceleration. All pans and tilts are manually done as players use the controls to see anything besides where the character is heading. The only change in FOV occurs when Batman is using his grappling hook, not when he is gliding.</p><h2 id="2fb0" class="acr abd ty bg abe ls acs lt lv lw act lx lz iy acu iz jc mc acv md mg mh acw mi ml acx bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">Spider-Man 2018</h2><p id="3021" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up abv yv yw ur abw yy yz za abx zc zd ze aby zg zh zi abz zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">Unlike Batman, Spider-Man was very much made for large scale traversal. As this is the first entry in the series, Spider-Man was made from ground up with large scale traversal in mind. And unlike Batman, much of other Spider-Man media covers his relationship with a huge city like New York and how he manages the commute (with or without superpowers).<br>New York is not like Gotham though. While both feature tall skyscrapers, Gotham has a mix of building of various heights in the same place. New York on the other hand clubs tall building together, medium sized building together, and flatter architecture together. This eliminates any steps, ladders, and terraces in an area. When Spider-Man moves through a burrow/ block of New York, he travels through a uniform height of architecture. Which means the preferred height and scale of verticality does not change frequently and the player can focus on the pure horizontal motion of Spider-Man.</p></div></div><div class="zs"><div class="ac cr"><div class="xx cp xy co xz cn se aca sf acb hb bi"><div class="zn zo zp zq zr ac gv"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2400/1*dtkHhgL7ho_oPhfLZ_rDOw.jpeg" width="702" height="395" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2700/1*wikwLk3DHMsbg2KtC7H7UQ.jpeg" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Arkham City has a terracing effect while verticality of NYC is uniform for large chunks of area</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div class="ac cr"><div class="hb bi hc hd he hf"><p id="ddd5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">While Batman’s motion originates from aiming and shooting a grapple hook at different distances and achieving verticality to launch himself, Spider-Man shows a more rhythmic horizontal motion where shooting webs is the rhythm rather than generating the force for launch and motion. Batman does not swing, he generates force so he can glide. Spider-Man swings, which introduces rhythm to the motion. This creates the first and a fundamental difference between the two games’ traversal and 3Cs. While I have no experience in Level Design, as a Gameplay Designer it is exceptionally important for the players to be able to experience spaces and volumes in a fun way.</p><p id="f07f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="yt lr">Character</strong><br>Spider-Man is a slim, lean, agile, and an athletic character. A huge part of Spider-Man is not only reaching from A to B, but the style in which he does it. Complex, athletic movements coupled with tight gymnastics is how Spider-Man has always moved, and the game encapsulates it very well.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*6kIUSxtJhBz8XHDn3rQVNA.jpeg" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Spider-Man is a nimble and small character, allowing players to contextualise him within his surroundings.

But unlike Batman, he is free to choose and change his direction right from the start.<br>Spider-Man actually achieves different horizontal velocities while swinging at different vertical heights. While this completely defies physics, this gives players a reason to vary their own sense of verticality. It is quite relaxed and leisurely at higher altitudes, which actually enhances the amazing view. Whereas the speed gained is amazing and thrilling at lower altitudes, which is massively enhanced by the challenge of dodging incoming traffic and slight loss of control due to the increased velocity.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*0z_tsEapGM0vkuL2aAT1Jg.gif" width="600" height="338" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></div></div><div class="zs"><div class="ac cr"><div class="xx cp xy co xz cn se aca sf acb hb bi"><div class="zn zo zp zq zr ac gv"> </div><div><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*D31-8RVpP1bU4oOTdzlbJw.gif" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Slower swing is more stylistic and leisurely whereas faster swing is more challenging and thrilling (and rewarding, when speed is crucial)</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div class="ac cr"><div class="hb bi hc hd he hf"><p id="8a56" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="yt lr">Controller</strong><br>Spider-Man is much more reactive to the controller on his feet and in the air. While the game borrows a lot from the snappiness of the Arkham series, there is much more free form control when Spider-Man is swinging. This allows even better mobility and allows organic, physical dexterity to come into play.<br>One thing this game excels at is allowing Spider-Man to travel in style. Not only does he do a number of animations, but players can also do stunts with Spider-Man. This creates an intrinsic challenge where not only reaching from point A to B matters, but the style in which one reaches. It is largely optional, but for an activity that is so dominant of the player’s time and attention, it adds some change and inherent challenges to spice it up.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*7rIUt0hNSflVioGKfp4GUQ.gif" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>The stunts offer to spice up long drawn session of simple traversal</figcaption></figure><p id="f10e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="yt lr">Camera</strong><br>The camera is one of the best aspects of Spider-Man. It does not only enable the fluid and well animated character, it enhances everything. It creates a sense of motion, momentum, acceleration, and change while anchoring it to a relevant three-dimensional context. There are many layers to the camera that individually react to the controller, so let’s tackle them one by one.</p><p id="31bd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="yt lr">Camera and controller</strong><br>The reason why Spider-Man feel so obedient is that he reacts to player intention more than Batman. The left analog stick is solely dedicated to controlling Spider-Man and right analog stick is dedicated to controlling the camera. But Spider-Man actually aligns himself to the camera, so it’s quite simple to steer him. It’s as easy as pointing the camera to where the player wants to be. So directing the character directly causes the camera to align, and directing the camera causes the character to align. Access to both these ways allows the system to be approachable by many different kinds of players.

Batman, as a character, has much more realistic depiction of mass. Batman actually has generate torque using physically (somewhat) realistic centrifugal force. This disables him from making sharp and acute turns to orient himself. On the other hand, Spider-Man defies many properties of physics. He unrealistically defies principles of torque, generating large centrifugal force despite having a very small radius (where r in mr² is unrealistically small). Yet the beauty of the motion and the way the camera presents it to us allows suspension of disbelief, and allows Spider-Man to take advantage of a better reacting controller.</p><figure class="zn zo

While it is a dominant activity, it will not be on the forefront of players’ minds when they are more focused on reaching the location to probably shoot, hack-n-slash, or solve a puzzle.

The character and controller are both very accommodating of the player and allow them to interact with the world in other ways than just to focus on the traversal, thereby reducing the monotonous nature of the activity.</p></div></div><div class="zs"><div class="ac cr"><div class="xx cp xy co xz cn se aca sf acb hb bi"><div class="zn zo zp zq zr ac gv"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*HG5wYU9ITZM1xArQubOSNg.gif" width="600" height="337" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*qh9uHI5MQghFYk7IhQ49Lg.gif" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>The devs explain the amazing system of affordances in their GDC talk <a class="ah oy" href="https://youtu.be/TawhcWao9ls?t=844" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">here</a></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div class="ac cr"><div class="hb bi hc hd he hf"><p id="caac" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">Such careful emphasis on a traversal system that actually de-escalates its importance in the player’s mind is a starkly different approach than Spider-Man where they allow the traversal system to shine on its own.</p><p id="92de" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">While horses are becoming commonplace (along with bows), one of the greatest pioneers of large, open world games actually used a more modern vehicle — cars.

Even Batman Arkham Knight, successor to Arkham City, features the Bat-Mobile as a dominant form of traversal. Some of these games also feature boats, jet-skis, planes, helicopters, etc. But the two games that I want to bring to light in this category are Saints Row 4 and Infamous Second Son.</p><p id="87f0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph yr ys ty yt b up yu yv yw ur yx yy yz za zb zc zd ze zf zg zh zi zj zk zl zm fo bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">Saints Row 4 is the world from GTA but on performance steroids.

This creates a puzzle like approach to climbing and traversing massive buildings, ranging from sprouting wings and gliding, hovering on a smoke, or being a pure force of electricity. Various building and spaces demand the players to use these different abilities and their different traversal mechanics to keep variation in an otherwise monotonous task of moving between point A and
