But the game wasn’t built ground up for mobile and it had no reactive UI and touch controls.</p><p>I was hired to lead a nearly 2 year long effort to make key changes to the UI, the interactions, and at some points to the core graphics and UI codebase, to make sure that Rocksmith’s debut on mobile is as accessible as its PC and game console counterpart. This was Ubisoft’s first truly multiplatform game built using their proprietary Snowdrop engine that would become the platform for all their future mobile and PC games.</p><p><a href="./../rocksmith-mobile/">Click here to read more</a></p><hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Improving day 7 retention for Guild of Guardians</h2><p>For video games, D7 retention is a make or break metric because it signals if your game has product market fit or not. It measures if a player comes back after 7 days from the first time they played the game or not.</p><p>Guild of Guardians was below industry benchmarks for D7 retention when compared to other similar products, but not low enough to consider the game a failure. This was an opportunity for improvements.</p><p>I was tasked to analyse what specific issues were causing players to not continue playing within the first 7 days. My initial research led to noticing key gaps between our understanding of our players against which we tested two distinct options. This was a project where my intuition went against the rest of the team’s gut reaction and I had to convince everyone to change the key focus area.</p><p><a href="./../afk-rewards-for-guild-of-guardians/">Click here to read more</a></p><hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vibe prototyping a content feed for Immutable Play</h2><p>We ideated and built a fully working prototype within a day using Claude in Cursor.
