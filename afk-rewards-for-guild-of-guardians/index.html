Turns out it only explain 24% of the variance in the model, but the result is significant and the odds ratio explains that every 1 unit increase in average sessions/day would increase probability of player retaining by 16%.

In Guild of Guardians, you get gold for playing. And you can use that gold to get stronger swords and sturdier shields to defeat bigger monsters. What's the catch? If you don't login in enough times, you can get as much gold as you're supposed to. So you're weaker, the boss is more difficult because your weapons are rustier.

Given how we designed the product, a user had to login 3 times a day to get the most rewards. We just saw with data and opinions that such a cadence does not fit in the lifestyle of most of our players. And if they did not login 3 times a day, they will never get strong enough to win successfully.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So we had to do two things, build habits, and build them within a busy lifestyle.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the original flow, users had to come back to take an action and be rewarded.

This was a major contributing factor to low D7 retention. After analysing the data of what heroes they were using to fight, it turned out they were using the wrong strategic teams. I went around the office and asked employees who did not work on Guild of Guardians on their unbiased feedback. Many of them replied with not knowing why an enemy was powerful to then be able to infer what is the best team of heroes to use against them. After a quick workshop with my team, the easiest and simplest solution we arrived to was adding a reccomendation system to the progression.</p><p>Here is a before and after.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250828_080318_Guild-of-Guardians-2.png" data-size="2316x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250828_080318_Guild-of-Guardians-2-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a><figcaption>Before - players had no clue what heroes to use</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150237_Guild-of-Guardians-2.png" data-size="2316x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150237_Guild-of-Guardians-2-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a><figcaption>After - players had some reccomendation based on other players' performance</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>We had qualitative insights from players using surveys on some of the main reasons they quit the game in the first 7 days. Many players said that despite enjoying the game, they did not feel a sense of progression in the campaign. Additionally whenever they lost in a dungeon, they had to begin from the first dungeon. This design was an ill fit for a mobile game. So I championed and designed a new progression system and the UI for it to instill a sense of goals and a path of progression. Additionally I designed new a new dungeon progression system that used checkpoints so players can instantly reattempt the dungeon that they lost at instead of having to begin from the start.</p><p>Here is a before and after.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250915_114738_Guild-of-Guardians.png" data-size="2316x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250915_114738_Guild-of-Guardians-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a><figcaption>Before - players said that they had no sense of progression, and if they lost at room 13 of a dungeon they had to reattempt from the start</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150223_Guild-of-Guardians-1.png" data-size="2316x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150223_Guild-of-Guardians-1-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a><figcaption>After - a clear progression path.

Since our game had a plethora of legendary heroes that players wanted and would open gacha for and hope to get, I created a 7 day reward that let you pick 1 legendary guardian. This let players experience choice and autonomy at the end of long commitement, and the hypothesis was that delayed gratification would make players stay longer than day 7 in anticiaption of further dopamine rushes. The UI design for this feature was specifically chosen to look like a countdown calendar so the players had something to look forward to not only the next day, but a bumper reward in the next week.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians.png" alt="" width="900" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>Daily instant gratification rewards to create micro goals and a big delayed gratification reward at the end of the week with clear goals, context, and progress to creat macro goals</figcaption></figure><p>One of the final changes that I added was a moment of delight at getting the players first legendary hero. Originally players had to wait to get one from gacha, but I added an explicit scripted moment to get the first legendary hero after defeating the first boss. This decision was not informed by data as it is hard to analyse something that does not exist, so we A/B tested this implementation to see the impact. The players who got to experience this showed 68% higher likelihood of retaining to D7, which was made obvious by seeing the usage data of that legendary hero to clear out the first few dungeons. After the success of this moment of delight, I added a introductory offer with clear messaging to be paired with the delight for players who wished to fast track their progress in the campaign. Compared to our old, outdated introductory offer, it performed 342% better against new players and increase the odds a purchase making player to retain by 92%.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Screenshot_20251117_090321_Guild-of-Guardians.png" alt="" width="900" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251117_090321_Guild-of-Guardians-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251117_090321_Guild-of-Guardians-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251117_090321_Guild-of-Guardians-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251117_090321_Guild-of-Guardians-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>The old offer had no context and was not paired with a moment of delight.

The bimodal distribution became a normal distribution, and fewer overall players churned from these issues. While it is difficult to attribute the results to any single change, we collected enough qualitative feedback via surveys to refine individual designs.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/IMG_0490.png" alt="" width="450" height="376" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0490-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0490-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0490-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0490-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>The "average" is lower but the outcome is more consistent for more players than before with overall higher retention</figcaption></figure><p>We also knew through linear regression analysis that session length was a good indicator of retention and all these changes were resulting in higher average session legnth in the first 7 days of a players' user journey. </p><p>Additionally using free content to grab the players attention followed by a surgically place offer with very clear messaging and value proposition increased our D7 LTV (money made from a player within their first 7 days from creating an account) by over 12%! This was a double win for the team.</p><hr><h1>Learning</h1><p></p><p></p><p>This was a major block of work that took multiple months and was shipped over multiple releases. The discovery phase started by undertanding that what players are lacking is beyond the screen, it's a mismatch of the game's user experience and their habits and lifestyle. Once we understood that, we knew we had to make critical changes to features besides just updating the UI. But with insights backed by data, we could confidently commit to this long endeavour to deliver value with constant iteration and see each addition and iteration having an impact on our business goals. Confidence in vision is key to keep the team motivated when the development period is long and uncertain.</p><p> </p><div class="wp-block-group alignfull" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-top: var(--wp--preset--spacing--50); padding-bottom: var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);"><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-columns alignwide"><p></p><div class="wp-block-column" style="padding: var(--wp--preset--spacing--10);"><p></p><div class="wp-block-group"><p></p><div class="wp-block-group"><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized has-custom-border"><figure class="wp-image-94"><img loading="lazy" style="border-radius: 100px; aspect-ratio: 1; object-fit: cover; width: 60px;" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/josiah.jpeg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/josiah-xs.jpeg 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/josiah-sm.jpeg 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/josiah-md.jpeg 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/josiah-lg.jpeg 1024w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center is-testimonial-name has-small-font-size" style="line-height: 1;"><em>Josiah Wallace, Senior Game Design Manager</em></h3><p></p></div><p></p><p></p><blockquote><p class="has-text-align-center is-testimonial-review">"Data driven design is now a keystone in modern game development and there are few others like Bramha who combine the UX and Game Design know-how with the Data Analysis process &amp; procedure as well as he does.
