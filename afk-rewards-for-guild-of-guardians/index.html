But how do I know if the problem is with session per day and not with overall ability of the game to delight? If that were true, we would see very low engagement in the first session, but the opposite was true. This observation helped me craft the hypothesis that something was off in the return to the second session and onwards.</p><p>In Guild of Guardians, you get gold for playing. And you can use that gold to get stronger swords and sturdier shields to defeat bigger monsters. What's the catch? If you don't login in enough times, you can get as much gold as you're supposed to. So you're weaker, the boss is more difficult because your weapons are rustier.

Changing their behaviour to do what we wanted was going to be futile. Additionally, survivor bias had to be eliminated as people who churned did not answer these surveys, so a buffer was added to not overestimate how much users claimed to engage.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So comes the solution</p><p></p><p></p><p>At the current state of the game, you needed to spend 1 energy to defeat monsters automatically and automatically get gold. Given how we designed the product, a user had to login 3 times a day to get the most rewards. We just saw with data and opinions that such a cadence does not fit in the lifestyle of most of our players. And if they did not login 3 times a day, they will never get strong enough to win successfully.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So we had to do two things, build habits, and build them within a busy lifestyle.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the original flow, users had to come back to take an action and be rewarded.

The engineer on my team wanted to change this to a simple button for clarity but the UI artist made a great observation that we will not be able to do complex, eye catching, and delightful animations and VFX's with a button as well as with an image.

The progression worked in such a way that players would unlock a weapon to create excitement, but by the time they collected all the gold to acquire that weapon, they would also simultaneously unlock the next sword. This dampened the excitement of the reward they just received in the form of the sword, and every milestone went from being an opportunity to celebrate to a moment of setting a new goal without acknowledgement.<br><br>A simple fix was restructuring the existing progression in such a way that players would get all the gold required to unlock a sword over time, and they would unlock the new sword more or less around the time they got all the required gold. This created a satisfying moment upon return to immediately then get a sword and use to kill stronger enemies. This was a pretty invisible but highly impactful, under the hood, change to make</span></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" style="text-align: center; font-size: inherit;" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/IMG_0495.png" alt="" width="900" height="419" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>User experience is a lot about feelings and sometimes those feelings are beyond the influence of pure visual design.

This was a highly correlated factor to low D7 retention.</p><p>After analysing the data of what heroes they were using to fight, it turned out they were using weaker strategic teams. I went around the office and asked employees who did not work on Guild of Guardians but played it regularly for their unbiased feedback on this specific issue. Many of them replied with not knowing why an enemy was powerful to then be able to infer what is the best team of heroes to use against them. After a quick workshop with my team we discovered that the easiest and simplest solution we arrived to was adding a reccomendation system to the progression.</p><p>Here is how the experience looked like previously and then after the new feature was added</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250828_080318_Guild-of-Guardians-2.png" data-size="2316x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250828_080318_Guild-of-Guardians-2-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a><figcaption>Before - players had no clue what heroes to use</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150237_Guild-of-Guardians-2.png" data-size="2316x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150237_Guild-of-Guardians-2-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a><figcaption>After - players had some reccomendations based on other players' performance</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Through qualitative insights from talking to players, I also found out that players quit after losing once or twice because whenever they lost in a dungeon, they had to begin from the first dungeon. This design was an ill fit for a mobile game which easier and smoother progression. I worked directly with the game designers to add a new dungeon progression system that used checkpoints so players can instantly reattempt the dungeon that they lost at instead of having to begin from the start. This was a simply and purely UX change as no balancing or remaking of content was involved.</p><p><br>Here is how the experience looked like previously and then after the new feature was added</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250915_114738_Guild-of-Guardians.png" data-size="2316x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250915_114738_Guild-of-Guardians-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a><figcaption>Before - players said that they had no sense of progression, and if they lost at room 13 of a dungeon they had to reattempt from the start</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150223_Guild-of-Guardians-1.png" data-size="2316x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150223_Guild-of-Guardians-1-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a><figcaption>After - a clear progression path.

Since our game had a plethora of legendary heroes that players wanted and would open gacha for and hope to get, I created a 7 day reward that let you pick 1 legendary guardian. This let players experience choice and autonomy at the end of long commitement. The hypothesis was that delayed gratification would make players stay longer than day 7 in anticiaption of further dopamine rushes. The UI design for this feature was specifically chosen to look like a countdown calendar so the players had something to look forward to not only the next day but also a bumper reward at the end of the week.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians.png" alt="" width="900" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>Daily instant gratification rewards to create micro goals and a big delayed gratification reward at the end of the week with clear goals, context, and progress to creat macro goals</figcaption></figure><p>One of the final changes that I added was a moment of delight at getting the players first legendary hero. Originally players had to wait to get one from gacha, but I added an explicit scripted moment to get the first legendary hero after defeating the first boss.</p><p>This decision was not informed by pre-prepared data as it is hard to analyse something that does not exist, so we A/B tested this implementation to see the impact. The players who got to experience this showed 38% higher likelihood of retaining to D7 than players who did not, which was made obvious by seeing the usage data of that legendary hero to clear out the subsequent dungeons.</p><p>After the success of this moment of delight, I added a introductory offer with clear messaging to be paired with the delight for players who wished to fast track their progress in the campaign. Compared to our old, outdated introductory offer, it performed 342% better against new players and increase the odds of a purchase making player to retain by 92% higher than a player who did not.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Screenshot_20251117_090321_Guild-of-Guardians.png" alt="" width="900" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251117_090321_Guild-of-Guardians-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251117_090321_Guild-of-Guardians-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251117_090321_Guild-of-Guardians-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251117_090321_Guild-of-Guardians-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>The old offer had no context and was not paired with a moment of delight.

We could see this metric climb a little bit with every release and overall an amplified, higher impact after shipping some of the last features.</p><p>Additionally, using free content to grab the players attention followed by a surgically placed in-app offer with very clear messaging and value proposition increased our D7 LTV (money made from a player within their first 7 days from creating an account) by over 12%! Even though this was not our goal, this was a double win for the team.</p><hr><h1>Learning</h1><p></p><p></p><p>This was a major block of work that took multiple months and was shipped over multiple releases. The discovery phase started by undertanding that what players are lacking is beyond the screen, it's a mismatch of the game's user experience and their habits and lifestyle. Once we understood that, we knew we had to make critical changes to features besides just updating the UI.</p><p>But with hypothesis and insights backed by data about player behaviour, we could confidently commit to this long endeavour to deliver value with constant iteration and see each addition having an impact on our business goals. Confidence in vision is key to keep the team motivated when the development period is long and uncertain.</p><p> </p><div class="wp-block-group alignfull" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-top: var(--wp--preset--spacing--50); padding-bottom: var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);"><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-columns alignwide"><p></p><div class="wp-block-column" style="padding: var(--wp--preset--spacing--10);"><p></p><div class="wp-block-group"><p></p><div class="wp-block-group"><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized has-custom-border"><figure class="wp-image-94"><img loading="lazy" style="border-radius: 100px; aspect-ratio: 1; object-fit: cover; width: 60px;" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/josiah.jpeg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/josiah-xs.jpeg 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/josiah-sm.jpeg 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/josiah-md.jpeg 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/josiah-lg.jpeg 1024w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center is-testimonial-name has-small-font-size" style="line-height: 1;"><em>Josiah Wallace, Senior Game Design Manager</em></h3><p></p></div><p></p><p></p><blockquote><p class="has-text-align-center is-testimonial-review">"Data driven design is now a keystone in modern game development and there are few others like Bramha who combine the UX and Game Design know-how with the Data Analysis process &amp; procedure as well as he does.
