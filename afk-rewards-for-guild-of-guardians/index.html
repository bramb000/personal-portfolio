Basically, I want to see how much session/day explain D7 retention as these are session per day till the 6th day. Turns out it only explain 24% of the variance in the model, but the result is significant and the odds ratio explains that every 1 unit increase in average sessions/day would increase probability of player retaining by 16%. This definitely proves that something about logging in everyday made players retain to D7.

But how do I know if the problem is with session per day and not with overall ability of the game to delight? Well obviously I have a hunch because I play and develop video games for a living. In Guild of Guardians, you get gold for playing. And you can use that gold to get stronger swords and sturdier shields to defeat bigger monsters. What's the catch? If you don't login in enough times, you can get as much gold as you're supposed to. So you're weaker, the boss is more difficult because your weapons are rustier.

Changing their behaviour to do what we wanted was going to be futile. Additionally, survivor bias had to be eliminated as people who churned did not answer these surveys, so a buffer was added to not overestimate how much users claimed to engage.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So comes the solution</p><p></p><p></p><p>At the current state of the game, you needed to spend 1 energy to defeat monsters automatically and automatically get gold. Given how we designed the product, a user had to login 3 times a day to get the most rewards. We just saw with data and opinions that such a cadence does not fit in the lifestyle of most of our players. And if they did not login 3 times a day, they will never get strong enough to win successfully.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So we had to do two things, build habits, and build them within a busy lifestyle.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the original flow, users had to come back to take an action and be rewarded.
