They need to earn gold to strengthen their equipment and collect souls to level up their heroes.We had a problem, our D7 retention, the percent of players still continuing to play by the 7th day since they installed, was low.

D1 retention indicator is a result of if the user has liked the game's core premise, if the game matches the marketing, and other visceral reactions. But D7 retention is an indicator of how much the game has captured the players attention when they are not playing to bring them back and form habits. I was clear from the start from the team - we are optimising for D7 retention and not D1 retention. This requires a more nuanced way of thinking.A good indicator of D1 retention is session length. Usually playing a long first session is highly indicative of perception fit - the game is offering the exact itch that the marketing said it would scratch. For D7, it's more about seeing what initial habits the players form after their first 'wow' moment where they analyse the game more critically beyond the pure fun and see if a game fits their lifestyle through meta features like progression, matchmaking, etc.A good metric to track habit formation is sessions per day in the first seven days, where 1 session per day means users are playing the game at least 1 time per day.  By writing SQL to query our database in BigQuery, I could derive that the average session per day for new players who downloaded the game in the last 90 days was 1.3. While that sounds great, I trusted my instinct and background in statistics to look into the distribution of this number as averages can often be deceiving.What was surprising was that we had K shaped behaviour, the players who retained were playing so much that pulled the average up and practically blindsided the team.In nerd terms, this is a bimodal distribution and very few players are actually having the 'average' experience, and those below the average where definitely not sticking around and retaining, which was a clear indicator why having 1.3 sessions per day still resulted in such poor D7 retention.Read more about the nitty gritty mathI ran a logistic regression test on D7 retention as the dependent binary variable and sessions per day as the independent continuous variable. Basically, I want to see how much session/day explain D7 retention as these are session per day till the 6th day. Turns out it explained 24% of the variance in a complex model like retention.The tl;dr of this table is that every 1 unit increase in average sessions/day would increase probability of player retaining to day 7 by 16%. This definitely proves that something about logging in everyday made players retain to D7. Pretty obvious when you say it out aloud but this let me put together a clear case to convince my team's Executive Producer as to why we should prioritise this project and the estimated impact of this project.MetricCoefficient (β)Odds Ratio (Exp(β))T-StatisticDF LPM R-SquaredIntercept (β₀)0.003337018482N/AN/AN/AIndependent Var (β₁)0.1501199591.16197362498.77685328306340.2415612125 Every 1 unit increase in sessions/daywas 16% higher likelihood of retaning to 7 days In a world where I had more time, I would have loved to create a multivariable regression model exploring the relationship of D7 retention to session per day, session length (how long did you play each time), activation days (number of unique days played), activation days density (did you play a lot at the start or evenly spread), and game inventory linked to account level i.e. did player progress enough or feel accomplished enough to want to return the next day. Alas, for another day. The averages are different and it explains correlation. But how do I know if the problem is with session per day and not with overall ability of the game to delight? If that were true, we would see very low engagement in the first session - but the opposite was true with a healthy average 25 minutes first session length. The game had a healthy D1 retention compared to industry benchmarks which means that it was making an impression, just failing to hook players into coming back and forming habits.Proceeding with this investigation - in Guild of Guardians, you get gold and other resources for playing. And you can use those resources to get powerful heroes, stronger swords, and sturdier shields to defeat bigger monsters. What's the catch? If you don't login in enough times, you can get as much gold as you're supposed to. So you're weaker, the boss is more difficult because your weapons are weaker. This perfectly aligned with the original observation that users were logging in less than once per daily were failing to defeat specific bosses and dungeons.To make certain that I was chasing the correct lead, I ran a survey to understand the user stories behind the data.And came in hundreds of responsesInsight 1There was a question about when in the day do users play the game. The responses overwhelmingly confirmed this game was 'unstructured downtime' entertainment'When I am picking up my child and waiting in the car''When I'm on the toilet''When I'm in my commute' 73%Responders played the game in-between life activities (ranging from work to errands) Insight 2Some of the quotes from the survey about 'Do you feel the game's timers fit in your day to day life' were quite revealing'I feel the game punishes me for having a job, I usually play for an after work but this game punishes me for not playing 30 dedicated minutes twice or thrice in a day''I spend 15-20 minutes to get to the good stuff and then just as I get to the juicy part the game tells me that I am out of energy''I use my lunch break to do all the boring quest stuff so I can actually play the fun parts of the game later in the evening' 54%Responders did not feel the game timers matched their lifestyle Our game's energy system was practically interrupting users from getting into the flow state just as they were about to start enjoying their session.Insight 3A few responses to the question 'do you think about Guild of Guardians when you are not playing' revealed some key insights.'I usually forget about the game till the notification reminds me that I have energy''I got burned a few times by trying to time so now I just put it aside till I have energy and get the notification''I want to play as soon as my energy is full but I can't since I'm at work which raises my anxiety about my progress'21% of the survey answers outright mentioned that they did not think about the game in between game sessions. 21%absolutely did not think about the game in between sessions and 36%just passively waited to be reminded a timer had reached 0 These were all retained, active players. I imagined the experience felt worse to new players.The mismatch in the energy system and user lifestyle was creating negative feelings, and driving anticaption from loss rather than positive anticipation from expectation.All of these anecdotes higlighted that the original system did not take the user into consideration and was designed in a way to maximise vanity metrics like sessions per day and number of logins. Without considering the user, it not only failed but was actively harmful to important business goals like long term retention.This exercise helped me craft a clear persona that represented the data and the feelings - The Casual Connoisseur. They are characterised by someone who spends thousand of hours in a game, but will play casually at the start as a trial it before commiting. The hypothesisThe average user will play more if the game progression fit their lifestyle needsThe game will hook users for the long term if we shift from negative feelings of loss aversion to positive anticipation for the next sessionIn the original flow, users had to come back to take an action and be rewarded. This did not generate any anticipation excitement at the end of your previous session for you to not forget this game and want to come back after the first few times.Additionally, it was important to end a game session on a high note and make the player look forward to playing the next time as opposed to making them stop playing and forcing them away. So I redesigned the game loop and subsequently the user flow to start session on a happy note and end sessions on moments on anticipation for future rewards.Before - an energy system creates a forced action in the game loop that discourages returning behaviourAfter - I designed the loop in such a way that let players conclude their session naturally on a difficult boss that they can't just conquer or simply having played to long and have something to look forward to, creating a positive end to a journey to encourage formation of a loopThe old UI created feelings of punishment through it's presentation and messaging, it told you to stop playing as soon as things got interesting. Before - users had to come back after at least an hour to spend energy. Who finds that exciting?After proposing this analysis and hypothesis, the initial ideas involved a daily login calendar which is industry standard. Instead of going straight to designing an MVP, I asked players via a Discord thread on their thoughts about login calendars in other games.'I usually collect rewards on autopilot and forget about them''They are annoying and bombard me as soon as I open the game''They're pretty good but I don't open the game because of a daily reward''It's a bonus I guess'It was clear that while this type of a feature contributes to long term user retention, it does not drive it. It was clear that changes had to be made to the core progression and reward system to move the needle sizeably.My proposal to the team was to reposition the current energy system into an AFK (away from keyboard) reward system that collects resources while the user is away from the game. This means that when they are ready to leave the game, we can seed the anticipation by telling users that they will have rewards waiting for them to turn negative loss aversion into positive anticipation. And when they come back, the new session will begin with a moment of delight. After a workshop sessions to let everyone have input and provide feedback and a technical review, we aligned on the specific version of our feature.After the team agreed on the new user flow and the end goal of this design, I had to create 3 new UI components - A button on the main menu for this new feature, a screen for the new feature, and the tutorial for the new feature.I set out to mock up the new user flow with a combinations of existing and new screens in Figma to be able to map out how much new UI work was needed.Mocking up a super quick user flow with greybox wireframes to validate the hypothesisMy process starts with a brain dump and creating 5-6 quick sketches of a layout. Here are 2 concepts I stored from the general set of throwaway layouts I create.Iteration 1Iteration 2After brainstorming with the another UX designer and the UI Artist for external perspective, I finalised one layout focused on delivering rewards, celebrating receiving rewards, and setting up goals for the users. I proceeded to make a high fidelity mockup of that version.After - An AFK feature that helps user keep getting rewards while they are away from the game. I created this mockup in FigmaThe original first mockup that we built in the engine for internal prototyping had a button instead of a chest.A very rough in-engine mockup to get a feel. Originally every interaction in the popup was a buttonWhile I expected basic usability with this version - which is that most users could consistently complete the action and collect their rewards - my team's artist made a great remark that this screen was missing feelings of delight and the joy of unlocking many rewards accumulated in time away from the game. The engineer on my team wanted to keep the simple button for clarity and to reduce engineering effort, but after conducting competitive analysis we found out that most games in this genres have incredibly high bar of polish and animation for their rewards screen which is usually the 'dopamine' factor for these kinds of games.With buy-in and alignment from engineering after showing them the proof from other games on why we need to focus on a high bar for polish and animation, we built a fully fleshed out component that looked like a treasure chest filling up with rewards over time. All credit for this art and polish goes to our Senior UI Artist who pushed and advocated for creative flair in our UI, and I'm really glad I supported them to get this built against some initial internal hesitation.A delightfully full treasure chest in the main menu to make the user feel as if the game has been 'productive' in their time away to benefit themThe treasure chest starts filling up with rewards....and with time it gets full to the brimI always expected and my instinct was confirmed via playtests that the chest on the screen did not look like a button and did not look clickable, and in early internal testing users were confused on how to actually collect rewards. While the chest managed to delight users, it lost some aspect of standard usability - consistency with the rest of the UI so the users know what is interactable and what to expect.To re-focus and bring some aspects of this interaction back to usability, I decided a tutorial for the first visit to this screen was the best solution to teach the player that something which does not look like a button is actually a button. During internal testing with external team members, we also found out this lesson had a 100% memorisation rate, that means all of our participants of the playtest could remember the action 24 hours after the tutorial. I asked the community manager to keep a specific eye on complaints about this issue either via posts or support tickets and closely monitored data to see if players were stuck at this stage. There were no mentions of this particular issue over a 4 week monitoring period so I opted to forego analytical analysis to save time budget for design work.This is the quick and greybox tutorial I mocked up in Figma. This was eventually visually polished and animated by the UI artist before implementationThis was the final mocked up user flow in an interactable Figma prototype.The complete AFK Rewards experienceComplete AFK Rewards loopI ran a survey after the launch to gauge player sentimentQuestion 1 - 'What do you think of the new AFK Rewards?' (open ended)Some quotes'I don't have to think about this game during work, which means I can fully focus on it after work''The new system is far less annoying, I only have to open once a day and maybe twice if I really want rewards for the new events''It's nice to get all my rewards at the start and then just go into playing. Earlier, I did not look forward to using energy for the 15 minutes before I got to start playing what I actually wanted''Thank god y'all removed the arbitrary timer. Now I can consistently play every evening when I'm actually free'Question 2 - 'On a scale of 1 (Completely Disagree) to 5 (Completely Agree), do you feel the new timers and rewards make the overall game more enjoyable'72% respondersCompletely agreed that this user flow improved the overall gameTo close off the new game loop that I proposed, I added a quit screen that set goals and anticipation to encourage the user to come back.Before - A simple exit screen that does not create anticipationI made a very quick animation made in Figma to share the idea within the team. Ending the session on a note of future rewards created a strong reminder to come back and eventually builds habits. Work in progress - An animated exit screen that creates a timeline and clear goal for return timeTaking this idea, the artist polished the final UI. I used UI data to find out how many players close the game by pressing the close button in-game that triggers this dialogue vs how many players close the game through the operating system (like you do on iOS), which is much more common for mobile. Suriprisingly, only 12% players closed it using the dialogue. With so few players seeing this screen, I could not justify the ROI of spending lots of effort to develop and implement animations and encourage the artist to stop at static design.After - An exit screen that creates a timeline and clear goal for return timeBeyond just the UI and the visual user flow, there was a flaw in the progression design that would lead to an overall poor experience. The progression worked in such a way that players would unlock a weapon to create excitement, but by the time they collected all the gold to acquire that weapon, they would also simultaneously unlock the next sword. This dampened the excitement of the reward they just received, and every milestone went from being an opportunity to celebrate to a moment of setting a new goal and ignoring the achievement.The simplest fix was restructuring the existing progression in such a way that players would get all the gold required to unlock a sword over time, and they would unlock the new sword more or less around the time they got all the required gold. This created a satisfying moment upon return where players would get a sword after progressing through the campaign and immediately get to use it to kill stronger enemies. This was a pretty invisible and not related to the UI - but a highly impactful and under the hood change that made a world of difference. I need to be extra careful with this particular change as I did not want to give the player too many rewards and cannibalise monetisation.User experience is a lot about feelings and sometimes those feelings are beyond the influence of pure visual design. After implementing this feature, I found out through analysing further data as a retroanalysis that players would get stuck at specific dungeons in the campaign mode and they would quit the game after trying a few more times. This was a highly correlated factor to low D7 retention.This is a graph of average attempts of a dungeon (denoted by columns) and sum of players who quit after attempting but never clearing that specific dungeon. I could easily observe many dungeons where users were basically hitting their head against a wall46% of churned usershad attempted and lost at the same dungeon 2+ time in their first week 22% of churned usershad attempted and lost at the same dungeon 3+ times  After analysing the data of what heroes they were using to fight, it turned out they were using weaker strategic teams. I went around the office and asked employees who did not work on Guild of Guardians but played it regularly for their unbiased feedback on this specific issue. Many of them replied with not knowing why an enemy was powerful to then be able to infer what is the best team of heroes to use against them and only being able to proceed after getting that information from other advanced players.I wrote SQL queries to pull data of user behaviour from the last 60 days to validate this anecdotal data with statistically significant data.I could see a clear difference in heroes used by successful players (on the left) vs unsuccessful players who quit the game (on the right) by looking at the dataabout 50% users who quitMade no changes to their comp between attempt #1 and #2 After a quick workshop with my team we discovered that the easiest and simplest solution we arrived to was adding a reccomendation system using server wide hero usage data.Here is how the experience looked like previously and then after the new feature was addedBefore - players had no clue what heroes to useAfter - players had some recommendations based on other players' performanceThis feature was tricky to analyse because the feature was not clickable for the user, they could only read this information. So I had no direct way of knowing if it was helping or not. A proxy data point I used was to observe how many users used teams that were different from the recommendations in their first attempt and then used the recommended team in the next attempt to then clear the dungeon. The success of this funnel was increasing for multiple weeks until it settled around 70% (basically 70% of the players changed their team to the recommended team in their 2nd attempt to go on to complete the dungeon), so I could infer that users got actionable information from this feature to be able to positively impact their ability to win. 70% usersChanged their comp after loss #1 (up from 50%) And 67% of those usersCompleted the dungeon on Attempt #2Through qualitative insights from talking to players informally via Discord and analysing the messages using AI tools, I also found out that players quit after losing once or twice because whenever they lost in a dungeon, they had to begin from the start. This design was an ill fit for a mobile game which have easier and smoother progression. I collaborated directly with the game designer to add a new dungeon progression system that used checkpoints so players can instantly reattempt the dungeon that they lost at instead of having to begin from the start. This was a simply and purely UX change as no balancing or remaking of content was involved.Here is how the experience looked like previously and then after the new feature was addedBefore - players said that they had no sense of progression, and if they lost at room 13 of a dungeon they had to reattempt from the startAfter - a clear progression path. And if players lost at room 5, they could reattempt from room 5The next piece was to add a goal at the end of the 7 days to build anticipation and increase the odds of retaining to day 7.Since our game had a plethora of legendary heroes that players wanted and would open gacha for and hope to get, I created a 7 day reward that let you pick 1 legendary guardian. This let players experience choice and autonomy at the end of long commitment. The hypothesis was that delayed gratification would make players stay longer than day 7 in anticipation of further dopamine rushes. The UI design for this feature was specifically chosen to look like a countdown calendar so the players had something to look forward to not only the next day but also a bumper reward at the end of the week.This feature was not a big driver of early retention, but I observed a small bump in retention from Day 5 and Day 6 to Day 7 retention, which let me infer that this feature had great additional incentives for players who had already gotten over the earlier hurdles.Daily instant gratification rewards to create micro goals and a big delayed gratification reward at the end of the week with clear goals, context, and progress to create macro goals+3% increasein day 6 to day 7 retentionOne of the final changes that I added under this block of work was a moment of delight at getting the players first legendary hero. Originally players had to wait to get one from gacha or the newly implemented day 7 calendar rewards, but I added an explicit scripted moment to get the first legendary hero after defeating the first boss to make it feel celebratory and achieved by playing the game.This decision was not informed by pre-prepared data as it is hard to analyse something that does not exist, so we A/B tested this implementation to see the impact. The players who got to experience this showed 38% higher likelihood of retaining to D7 than players who did not, which was made obvious by seeing the usage data of that legendary hero to clear out the subsequent dungeons.I created this design in Figma with existing components of the design system as we did not have the availability of a UI designer for this feature. I got to exercise my visual design chops, although it would have been much faster and better with a dedicated visual designer+38% higher likelihooda user who received would retain compared to one who did notAfter the success of this moment of delight, I added an introductory offer with clear messaging to be paired with the delight for players who wished to fast track their progress in the campaign. Compared to our old, outdated introductory offer, it performed 162% better against the old offer and increased the odds of a purchase making player to retain to day 7 by 65% higher than a player who did not purchase this offer. Basically, it doubled the number of purchases and reduced buyer's regret so users who purchased continued to play.Before - The old offer had no context and was not paired with a moment of delight. Data showed that 99% of players closed the popup in under 1 second, and the team hypothesised together that a low quality offer is actually detrimental to retention99.9% usersClosed this popup instantlyAfter - The new offer had context and clear value proposition along with an improved presentation.

This perfectly aligned with the original observation that users were logging in less than once per daily were failing to defeat specific bosses and dungeons.To make certain that I was chasing the correct lead, I ran a survey to understand the user stories behind the data.And came in hundreds of responsesInsight 1There was a question about when in the day do users play the game.

Without considering the user, it not only failed but was actively harmful to important business goals like long term retention.This exercise helped me craft a clear persona that represented the data and the feelings - The Casual Connoisseur. They are characterised by someone who spends thousand of hours in a game, but will play casually at the start as a trial it before commiting. The hypothesisThe average user will play more if the game progression fit their lifestyle needsThe game will hook users for the long term if we shift from negative feelings of loss aversion to positive anticipation for the next sessionIn the original flow, users had to come back to take an action and be rewarded. This did not generate any anticipation excitement at the end of your previous session for you to not forget this game and want to come back after the first few times.Additionally, it was important to end a game session on a high note and make the player look forward to playing the next time as opposed to making them stop playing and forcing them away. So I redesigned the game loop and subsequently the user flow to start session on a happy note and end sessions on moments on anticipation for future rewards.Before - an energy system creates a forced action in the game loop that discourages returning behaviourAfter - I designed the loop in such a way that let players conclude their session naturally on a difficult boss that they can't just conquer or simply having played to long and have something to look forward to, creating a positive end to a journey to encourage formation of a loopThe old UI created feelings of punishment through it's presentation and messaging, it told you to stop playing as soon as things got interesting. Before - users had to come back after at least an hour to spend energy. Who finds that exciting?After proposing this analysis and hypothesis, the initial ideas involved a daily login calendar which is industry standard. Instead of going straight to designing an MVP, I asked players via a Discord thread on their thoughts about login calendars in other games.'I usually collect rewards on autopilot and forget about them''They are annoying and bombard me as soon as I open the game''They're pretty good but I don't open the game because of a daily reward''It's a bonus I guess'It was clear that while this type of a feature contributes to long term user retention, it does not drive it. It was clear that changes had to be made to the core progression and reward system to move the needle sizeably.My proposal to the team was to reposition the current energy system into an AFK (away from keyboard) reward system that collects resources while the user is away from the game. This means that when they are ready to leave the game, we can seed the anticipation by telling users that they will have rewards waiting for them to turn negative loss aversion into positive anticipation. And when they come back, the new session will begin with a moment of delight. After a workshop sessions to let everyone have input and provide feedback and a technical review, we aligned on the specific version of our feature.After the team agreed on the new user flow and the end goal of this design, I had to create 3 new UI components - A button on the main menu for this new feature, a screen for the new feature, and the tutorial for the new feature.I set out to mock up the new user flow with a combinations of existing and new screens in Figma to be able to map out how much new UI work was needed.Mocking up a super quick user flow with greybox wireframes to validate the hypothesisMy process starts with a brain dump and creating 5-6 quick sketches of a layout. Here are 2 concepts I stored from the general set of throwaway layouts I create.Iteration 1Iteration 2After brainstorming with the another UX designer and the UI Artist for external perspective, I finalised one layout focused on delivering rewards, celebrating receiving rewards, and setting up goals for the users. I proceeded to make a high fidelity mockup of that version.After - An AFK feature that helps user keep getting rewards while they are away from the game. I created this mockup in FigmaThe original first mockup that we built in the engine for internal prototyping had a button instead of a chest.A very rough in-engine mockup to get a feel. Originally every interaction in the popup was a buttonWhile I expected basic usability with this version - which is that most users could consistently complete the action and collect their rewards - my team's artist made a great remark that this screen was missing feelings of delight and the joy of unlocking many rewards accumulated in time away from the game. The engineer on my team wanted to keep the simple button for clarity and to reduce engineering effort, but after conducting competitive analysis we found out that most games in this genres have incredibly high bar of polish and animation for their rewards screen which is usually the 'dopamine' factor for these kinds of games.With buy-in and alignment from engineering after showing them the proof from other games on why we need to focus on a high bar for polish and animation, we built a fully fleshed out component that looked like a treasure chest filling up with rewards over time. All credit for this art and polish goes to our Senior UI Artist who pushed and advocated for creative flair in our UI, and I'm really glad I supported them to get this built against some initial internal hesitation.A delightfully full treasure chest in the main menu to make the user feel as if the game has been 'productive' in their time away to benefit themThe treasure chest starts filling up with rewards....and with time it gets full to the brimI always expected and my instinct was confirmed via playtests that the chest on the screen did not look like a button and did not look clickable, and in early internal testing users were confused on how to actually collect rewards. While the chest managed to delight users, it lost some aspect of standard usability - consistency with the rest of the UI so the users know what is interactable and what to expect.To re-focus and bring some aspects of this interaction back to usability, I decided a tutorial for the first visit to this screen was the best solution to teach the player that something which does not look like a button is actually a button. During internal testing with external team members, we also found out this lesson had a 100% memorisation rate, that means all of our participants of the playtest could remember the action 24 hours after the tutorial. I asked the community manager to keep a specific eye on complaints about this issue either via posts or support tickets and closely monitored data to see if players were stuck at this stage. There were no mentions of this particular issue over a 4 week monitoring period so I opted to forego analytical analysis to save time budget for design work.This is the quick and greybox tutorial I mocked up in Figma. This was eventually visually polished and animated by the UI artist before implementationThis was the final mocked up user flow in an interactable Figma prototype.The complete AFK Rewards experienceComplete AFK Rewards loopI ran a survey after the launch to gauge player sentimentQuestion 1 - 'What do you think of the new AFK Rewards?' (open ended)Some quotes'I don't have to think about this game during work, which means I can fully focus on it after work''The new system is far less annoying, I only have to open once a day and maybe twice if I really want rewards for the new events''It's nice to get all my rewards at the start and then just go into playing. Earlier, I did not look forward to using energy for the 15 minutes before I got to start playing what I actually wanted''Thank god y'all removed the arbitrary timer. Now I can consistently play every evening when I'm actually free'Question 2 - 'On a scale of 1 (Completely Disagree) to 5 (Completely Agree), do you feel the new timers and rewards make the overall game more enjoyable'72% respondersCompletely agreed that this user flow improved the overall gameTo close off the new game loop that I proposed, I added a quit screen that set goals and anticipation to encourage the user to come back.Before - A simple exit screen that does not create anticipationI made a very quick animation made in Figma to share the idea within the team. Ending the session on a note of future rewards created a strong reminder to come back and eventually builds habits. Work in progress - An animated exit screen that creates a timeline and clear goal for return timeTaking this idea, the artist polished the final UI. I used UI data to find out how many players close the game by pressing the close button in-game that triggers this dialogue vs how many players close the game through the operating system (like you do on iOS), which is much more common for mobile. Suriprisingly, only 12% players closed it using the dialogue. With so few players seeing this screen, I could not justify the ROI of spending lots of effort to develop and implement animations and encourage the artist to stop at static design.After - An exit screen that creates a timeline and clear goal for return timeBeyond just the UI and the visual user flow, there was a flaw in the progression design that would lead to an overall poor experience. The progression worked in such a way that players would unlock a weapon to create excitement, but by the time they collected all the gold to acquire that weapon, they would also simultaneously unlock the next sword. This dampened the excitement of the reward they just received, and every milestone went from being an opportunity to celebrate to a moment of setting a new goal and ignoring the achievement.The simplest fix was restructuring the existing progression in such a way that players would get all the gold required to unlock a sword over time, and they would unlock the new sword more or less around the time they got all the required gold. This created a satisfying moment upon return where players would get a sword after progressing through the campaign and immediately get to use it to kill stronger enemies. This was a pretty invisible and not related to the UI - but a highly impactful and under the hood change that made a world of difference. I need to be extra careful with this particular change as I did not want to give the player too many rewards and cannibalise monetisation.User experience is a lot about feelings and sometimes those feelings are beyond the influence of pure visual design. After implementing this feature, I found out through analysing further data as a retroanalysis that players would get stuck at specific dungeons in the campaign mode and they would quit the game after trying a few more times. This was a highly correlated factor to low D7 retention.This is a graph of average attempts of a dungeon (denoted by columns) and sum of players who quit after attempting but never clearing that specific dungeon. I could easily observe many dungeons where users were basically hitting their head against a wall46% of churned usershad attempted and lost at the same dungeon 2+ time in their first week 22% of churned usershad attempted and lost at the same dungeon 3+ times  After analysing the data of what heroes they were using to fight, it turned out they were using weaker strategic teams. I went around the office and asked employees who did not work on Guild of Guardians but played it regularly for their unbiased feedback on this specific issue. Many of them replied with not knowing why an enemy was powerful to then be able to infer what is the best team of heroes to use against them and only being able to proceed after getting that information from other advanced players.I wrote SQL queries to pull data of user behaviour from the last 60 days to validate this anecdotal data with statistically significant data.I could see a clear difference in heroes used by successful players (on the left) vs unsuccessful players who quit the game (on the right) by looking at the dataabout 50% users who quitMade no changes to their comp between attempt #1 and #2 After a quick workshop with my team we discovered that the easiest and simplest solution we arrived to was adding a reccomendation system using server wide hero usage data.Here is how the experience looked like previously and then after the new feature was addedBefore - players had no clue what heroes to useAfter - players had some recommendations based on other players' performanceThis feature was tricky to analyse because the feature was not clickable for the user, they could only read this information. So I had no direct way of knowing if it was helping or not. A proxy data point I used was to observe how many users used teams that were different from the recommendations in their first attempt and then used the recommended team in the next attempt to then clear the dungeon. The success of this funnel was increasing for multiple weeks until it settled around 70% (basically 70% of the players changed their team to the recommended team in their 2nd attempt to go on to complete the dungeon), so I could infer that users got actionable information from this feature to be able to positively impact their ability to win. 70% usersChanged their comp after loss #1 (up from 50%) And 67% of those usersCompleted the dungeon on Attempt #2Through qualitative insights from talking to players informally via Discord and analysing the messages using AI tools, I also found out that players quit after losing once or twice because whenever they lost in a dungeon, they had to begin from the start. This design was an ill fit for a mobile game which have easier and smoother progression. I collaborated directly with the game designer to add a new dungeon progression system that used checkpoints so players can instantly reattempt the dungeon that they lost at instead of having to begin from the start. This was a simply and purely UX change as no balancing or remaking of content was involved.Here is how the experience looked like previously and then after the new feature was addedBefore - players said that they had no sense of progression, and if they lost at room 13 of a dungeon they had to reattempt from the startAfter - a clear progression path. And if players lost at room 5, they could reattempt from room 5The next piece was to add a goal at the end of the 7 days to build anticipation and increase the odds of retaining to day 7.Since our game had a plethora of legendary heroes that players wanted and would open gacha for and hope to get, I created a 7 day reward that let you pick 1 legendary guardian. This let players experience choice and autonomy at the end of long commitment. The hypothesis was that delayed gratification would make players stay longer than day 7 in anticipation of further dopamine rushes. The UI design for this feature was specifically chosen to look like a countdown calendar so the players had something to look forward to not only the next day but also a bumper reward at the end of the week.This feature was not a big driver of early retention, but I observed a small bump in retention from Day 5 and Day 6 to Day 7 retention, which let me infer that this feature had great additional incentives for players who had already gotten over the earlier hurdles.Daily instant gratification rewards to create micro goals and a big delayed gratification reward at the end of the week with clear goals, context, and progress to create macro goals+3% increasein day 6 to day 7 retentionOne of the final changes that I added under this block of work was a moment of delight at getting the players first legendary hero. Originally players had to wait to get one from gacha or the newly implemented day 7 calendar rewards, but I added an explicit scripted moment to get the first legendary hero after defeating the first boss to make it feel celebratory and achieved by playing the game.This decision was not informed by pre-prepared data as it is hard to analyse something that does not exist, so we A/B tested this implementation to see the impact. The players who got to experience this showed 38% higher likelihood of retaining to D7 than players who did not, which was made obvious by seeing the usage data of that legendary hero to clear out the subsequent dungeons.I created this design in Figma with existing components of the design system as we did not have the availability of a UI designer for this feature. I got to exercise my visual design chops, although it would have been much faster and better with a dedicated visual designer+38% higher likelihooda user who received would retain compared to one who did notAfter the success of this moment of delight, I added an introductory offer with clear messaging to be paired with the delight for players who wished to fast track their progress in the campaign. Compared to our old, outdated introductory offer, it performed 162% better against the old offer and increased the odds of a purchase making player to retain to day 7 by 65% higher than a player who did not purchase this offer. Basically, it doubled the number of purchases and reduced buyer's regret so users who purchased continued to play.Before - The old offer had no context and was not paired with a moment of delight. Data showed that 99% of players closed the popup in under 1 second, and the team hypothesised together that a low quality offer is actually detrimental to retention99.9% usersClosed this popup instantlyAfter - The new offer had context and clear value proposition along with an improved presentation.

The ProblemThe game suffered from a lower than standard D7 retention. Users reported that they needed to play 3-4 times a day to maximise their progression when most users only had time to play 1-2 times a day, creating an ill fit for user lifestyle needs.02. The DataUsing SQL (BigQuery), I identified that the most engaged users were pulling the average session/day metric up and that the average experience felt worse to most users compared to what the dashboards indicated. Most users were playing once a day and therefore lagging behind in a progression system that needed them to play 3 times a day for the best results.03. The SolutionShifting Player Emotions: Designed an 'AFK Reward Feature' that accumulated rewards while the player was away, transforming the mental model from 'I'm missing out' when not playing to 'I have a gift waiting for me.' Adjusted reward timer to better fit user lifestyle.Designing for Delight: Changing the game loop to reframe features that interrupted player focus to a loop that creates positive anticipation as a hook for long term retention by creating habits. End to end delivery: Designed supporting features - composition reccomendation, daily login calendar, and free rewards for achievements to maximise D7 retentionBonus Win: Increase D7 LTV (revenue from a user in their first 7 days) by 12% by surgically adding monetisation offers to new featuresContext Guild of Guardians is a midcore RPG game where users create teams of 5 guardians to duke it out against monsters, enemies, and other players. In the first 7 to 10 days, the users are expected to play the Adventure mode where they explore the story, learn about the characters, and fight some easy monsters to learn about the game. They need to earn gold to strengthen their equipment and collect souls to level up their heroes.We had a problem, our D7 retention, the percent of players still continuing to play by the 7th day since they installed, was low. Which means we lost players who we spend lots of money to acquire which reduced the efficiency of our marketing budget.On top of this, we did not have a dedicated data analyst and user researcher to help us figure out what is happening to guide user research to figure out why it may be happening.I drove the project starting from these challengesTo these outcome ActionTLDRProblems analysed through a mixture of quantitiative and qualitative data analysisPoor structure of sessions → it always ended on a negative noteLack of recommendations when players get stuckLack of visual goal settingLack of celebration of milestonesHow I led the team to fix itMake UX and game economy changes to make sure player ends game session on a happy note with anticipation for the next timeAdd a strategy recommendation system that nudges and guides while maintaining player autonomyCreate visual UI that creates a path and goal settingAdded moments of celebrations and paired them with in-app purchases to score a double win on retention and monetisationA quick before and after of the features and screens I worked on throughout this entire processOld user flow to use adventure energy, get rewards, upgrade, and fightNew user flow to get rewards as soon you open the game, upgrade, and get into combatBefore - No visual goal settingAfter - Visual goal settingBefore - Lacklustre offersAfter - Highly contextual, lore driven offersBefore - No reccomendationsAfter - Popular recommendationsBefore - No anciticipationAfter - Ancticipations for next timeBeing a live product, looking at data is always my first step. D1 retention indicator is a result of if the user has liked the game's core premise, if the game matches the marketing, and other visceral reactions. But D7 retention is an indicator of how much the game has captured the players attention when they are not playing to bring them back and form habits. I was clear from the start from the team - we are optimising for D7 retention and not D1 retention. This requires a more nuanced way of thinking.A good indicator of D1 retention is session length. Usually playing a long first session is highly indicative of perception fit - the game is offering the exact itch that the marketing said it would scratch. For D7, it's more about seeing what initial habits the players form after their first 'wow' moment where they analyse the game more critically beyond the pure fun and see if a game fits their lifestyle through meta features like progression, matchmaking, etc.A good metric to track habit formation is sessions per day in the first seven days, where 1 session per day means users are playing the game at least 1 time per day.  By writing SQL to query our database in BigQuery, I could derive that the average session per day for new players who downloaded the game in the last 90 days was 1.3. While that sounds great, I trusted my instinct and background in statistics to look into the distribution of this number as averages can often be deceiving.What was surprising was that we had K shaped behaviour, the players who retained were playing so much that pulled the average up and practically blindsided the team.In nerd terms, this is a bimodal distribution and very few players are actually having the 'average' experience, and those below the average where definitely not sticking around and retaining, which was a clear indicator why having 1.3 sessions per day still resulted in such poor D7 retention.Read more about the nitty gritty mathI ran a logistic regression test on D7 retention as the dependent binary variable and sessions per day as the independent continuous variable. Basically, I want to see how much session/day explain D7 retention as these are session per day till the 6th day. Turns out it explained 24% of the variance in a complex model like retention.The tl;dr of this table is that every 1 unit increase in average sessions/day would increase probability of player retaining to day 7 by 16%. This definitely proves that something about logging in everyday made players retain to D7. Pretty obvious when you say it out aloud but this let me put together a clear case to convince my team's Executive Producer as to why we should prioritise this project and the estimated impact of this project.MetricCoefficient (β)Odds Ratio (Exp(β))T-StatisticDF LPM R-SquaredIntercept (β₀)0.003337018482N/AN/AN/AIndependent Var (β₁)0.1501199591.16197362498.77685328306340.2415612125 Every 1 unit increase in sessions/daywas 16% higher likelihood of retaning to 7 days In a world where I had more time, I would have loved to create a multivariable regression model exploring the relationship of D7 retention to session per day, session length (how long did you play each time), activation days (number of unique days played), activation days density (did you play a lot at the start or evenly spread), and game inventory linked to account level i.e. did player progress enough or feel accomplished enough to want to return the next day. Alas, for another day. The averages are different and it explains correlation. But how do I know if the problem is with session per day and not with overall ability of the game to delight? If that were true, we would see very low engagement in the first session - but the opposite was true with a healthy average 25 minutes first session length. The game had a healthy D1 retention compared to industry benchmarks which means that it was making an impression, just failing to hook players into coming back and forming habits.Proceeding with this investigation - in Guild of Guardians, you get gold and other resources for playing. And you can use those resources to get powerful heroes, stronger swords, and sturdier shields to defeat bigger monsters. What's the catch? If you don't login in enough times, you can get as much gold as you're supposed to. So you're weaker, the boss is more difficult because your weapons are weaker.

While the chest managed to delight users, it lost some aspect of standard usability - consistency with the rest of the UI so the users know what is interactable and what to expect.To re-focus and bring some aspects of this interaction back to usability, I decided a tutorial for the first visit to this screen was the best solution to teach the player that something which does not look like a button is actually a button. During internal testing with external team members, we also found out this lesson had a 100% memorisation rate, that means all of our participants of the playtest could remember the action 24 hours after the tutorial. I asked the community manager to keep a specific eye on complaints about this issue either via posts or support tickets and closely monitored data to see if players were stuck at this stage. There were no mentions of this particular issue over a 4 week monitoring period so I opted to forego analytical analysis to save time budget for design work.This is the quick and greybox tutorial I mocked up in Figma. This was eventually visually polished and animated by the UI artist before implementationThis was the final mocked up user flow in an interactable Figma prototype.The complete AFK Rewards experienceComplete AFK Rewards loopI ran a survey after the launch to gauge player sentimentQuestion 1 - 'What do you think of the new AFK Rewards?' (open ended)Some quotes'I don't have to think about this game during work, which means I can fully focus on it after work''The new system is far less annoying, I only have to open once a day and maybe twice if I really want rewards for the new events''It's nice to get all my rewards at the start and then just go into playing. Earlier, I did not look forward to using energy for the 15 minutes before I got to start playing what I actually wanted''Thank god y'all removed the arbitrary timer. Now I can consistently play every evening when I'm actually free'Question 2 - 'On a scale of 1 (Completely Disagree) to 5 (Completely Agree), do you feel the new timers and rewards make the overall game more enjoyable'72% respondersCompletely agreed that this user flow improved the overall gameTo close off the new game loop that I proposed, I added a quit screen that set goals and anticipation to encourage the user to come back.Before - A simple exit screen that does not create anticipationI made a very quick animation made in Figma to share the idea within the team. Ending the session on a note of future rewards created a strong reminder to come back and eventually builds habits. Work in progress - An animated exit screen that creates a timeline and clear goal for return timeTaking this idea, the artist polished the final UI. I used UI data to find out how many players close the game by pressing the close button in-game that triggers this dialogue vs how many players close the game through the operating system (like you do on iOS), which is much more common for mobile. Suriprisingly, only 12% players closed it using the dialogue. With so few players seeing this screen, I could not justify the ROI of spending lots of effort to develop and implement animations and encourage the artist to stop at static design.After - An exit screen that creates a timeline and clear goal for return timeBeyond just the UI and the visual user flow, there was a flaw in the progression design that would lead to an overall poor experience. The progression worked in such a way that players would unlock a weapon to create excitement, but by the time they collected all the gold to acquire that weapon, they would also simultaneously unlock the next sword. This dampened the excitement of the reward they just received, and every milestone went from being an opportunity to celebrate to a moment of setting a new goal and ignoring the achievement.The simplest fix was restructuring the existing progression in such a way that players would get all the gold required to unlock a sword over time, and they would unlock the new sword more or less around the time they got all the required gold. This created a satisfying moment upon return where players would get a sword after progressing through the campaign and immediately get to use it to kill stronger enemies. This was a pretty invisible and not related to the UI - but a highly impactful and under the hood change that made a world of difference. I need to be extra careful with this particular change as I did not want to give the player too many rewards and cannibalise monetisation.User experience is a lot about feelings and sometimes those feelings are beyond the influence of pure visual design. After implementing this feature, I found out through analysing further data as a retroanalysis that players would get stuck at specific dungeons in the campaign mode and they would quit the game after trying a few more times. This was a highly correlated factor to low D7 retention.This is a graph of average attempts of a dungeon (denoted by columns) and sum of players who quit after attempting but never clearing that specific dungeon. I could easily observe many dungeons where users were basically hitting their head against a wall46% of churned usershad attempted and lost at the same dungeon 2+ time in their first week 22% of churned usershad attempted and lost at the same dungeon 3+ times  After analysing the data of what heroes they were using to fight, it turned out they were using weaker strategic teams. I went around the office and asked employees who did not work on Guild of Guardians but played it regularly for their unbiased feedback on this specific issue. Many of them replied with not knowing why an enemy was powerful to then be able to infer what is the best team of heroes to use against them and only being able to proceed after getting that information from other advanced players.I wrote SQL queries to pull data of user behaviour from the last 60 days to validate this anecdotal data with statistically significant data.I could see a clear difference in heroes used by successful players (on the left) vs unsuccessful players who quit the game (on the right) by looking at the dataabout 50% users who quitMade no changes to their comp between attempt #1 and #2 After a quick workshop with my team we discovered that the easiest and simplest solution we arrived to was adding a reccomendation system using server wide hero usage data.Here is how the experience looked like previously and then after the new feature was addedBefore - players had no clue what heroes to useAfter - players had some recommendations based on other players' performanceThis feature was tricky to analyse because the feature was not clickable for the user, they could only read this information. So I had no direct way of knowing if it was helping or not. A proxy data point I used was to observe how many users used teams that were different from the recommendations in their first attempt and then used the recommended team in the next attempt to then clear the dungeon. The success of this funnel was increasing for multiple weeks until it settled around 70% (basically 70% of the players changed their team to the recommended team in their 2nd attempt to go on to complete the dungeon), so I could infer that users got actionable information from this feature to be able to positively impact their ability to win. 70% usersChanged their comp after loss #1 (up from 50%) And 67% of those usersCompleted the dungeon on Attempt #2Through qualitative insights from talking to players informally via Discord and analysing the messages using AI tools, I also found out that players quit after losing once or twice because whenever they lost in a dungeon, they had to begin from the start. This design was an ill fit for a mobile game which have easier and smoother progression. I collaborated directly with the game designer to add a new dungeon progression system that used checkpoints so players can instantly reattempt the dungeon that they lost at instead of having to begin from the start. This was a simply and purely UX change as no balancing or remaking of content was involved.Here is how the experience looked like previously and then after the new feature was addedBefore - players said that they had no sense of progression, and if they lost at room 13 of a dungeon they had to reattempt from the startAfter - a clear progression path. And if players lost at room 5, they could reattempt from room 5The next piece was to add a goal at the end of the 7 days to build anticipation and increase the odds of retaining to day 7.Since our game had a plethora of legendary heroes that players wanted and would open gacha for and hope to get, I created a 7 day reward that let you pick 1 legendary guardian. This let players experience choice and autonomy at the end of long commitment. The hypothesis was that delayed gratification would make players stay longer than day 7 in anticipation of further dopamine rushes. The UI design for this feature was specifically chosen to look like a countdown calendar so the players had something to look forward to not only the next day but also a bumper reward at the end of the week.This feature was not a big driver of early retention, but I observed a small bump in retention from Day 5 and Day 6 to Day 7 retention, which let me infer that this feature had great additional incentives for players who had already gotten over the earlier hurdles.Daily instant gratification rewards to create micro goals and a big delayed gratification reward at the end of the week with clear goals, context, and progress to create macro goals+3% increasein day 6 to day 7 retentionOne of the final changes that I added under this block of work was a moment of delight at getting the players first legendary hero. Originally players had to wait to get one from gacha or the newly implemented day 7 calendar rewards, but I added an explicit scripted moment to get the first legendary hero after defeating the first boss to make it feel celebratory and achieved by playing the game.This decision was not informed by pre-prepared data as it is hard to analyse something that does not exist, so we A/B tested this implementation to see the impact. The players who got to experience this showed 38% higher likelihood of retaining to D7 than players who did not, which was made obvious by seeing the usage data of that legendary hero to clear out the subsequent dungeons.I created this design in Figma with existing components of the design system as we did not have the availability of a UI designer for this feature. I got to exercise my visual design chops, although it would have been much faster and better with a dedicated visual designer+38% higher likelihooda user who received would retain compared to one who did notAfter the success of this moment of delight, I added an introductory offer with clear messaging to be paired with the delight for players who wished to fast track their progress in the campaign. Compared to our old, outdated introductory offer, it performed 162% better against the old offer and increased the odds of a purchase making player to retain to day 7 by 65% higher than a player who did not purchase this offer. Basically, it doubled the number of purchases and reduced buyer's regret so users who purchased continued to play.Before - The old offer had no context and was not paired with a moment of delight. Data showed that 99% of players closed the popup in under 1 second, and the team hypothesised together that a low quality offer is actually detrimental to retention99.9% usersClosed this popup instantlyAfter - The new offer had context and clear value proposition along with an improved presentation. I was confident in it's ability to outperform the old offerMore than doubledpurchases compared to the old offer","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bramha","url":"https://bramha.work/authors/bramha/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Bramha"}}</script><noscript><style>img[loading] {

D1 retention indicator is a result of if the user has liked the game's core premise, if the game matches the marketing, and other visceral reactions. But <strong>D7 retention is an indicator of how much the game has captured the players attention when they are not playing to bring them back and form habits</strong>. I was clear from the start from the team - we are optimising for D7 retention and not D1 retention. This requires a more nuanced way of thinking.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A good indicator of D1 retention is session length. Usually playing a long first session is highly indicative of perception fit - the game is offering the exact itch that the marketing said it would scratch. For D7, it's more about seeing what initial habits the players form after their first "wow" moment where they analyse the game more critically beyond the pure fun and see if a game fits their lifestyle through meta features like progression, matchmaking, etc.</p><p><strong>A good metric to track habit formation is sessions per day in the first seven days</strong>, where 1 session per day means users are playing the game at least 1 time per day.  By writing SQL to query our database in BigQuery, I could derive that <strong>the average session per day for new players who downloaded the game in the last 90 days was 1.3</strong>. While that sounds great, <strong>I trusted my instinct and background in statistics to look into the distribution of this number as averages can often be deceiving.</strong></p><p>What was surprising was that we had K shaped behaviour, <strong>the players who retained were playing so much that pulled the average up</strong> and practically blindsided the team.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/k-shape-problem.png" alt="" width="900" height="552" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/k-shape-problem-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/k-shape-problem-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/k-shape-problem-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/k-shape-problem-lg.webp 1024w"></figure><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In nerd terms, this is a bimodal distribution and very few players are actually having the "average" experience, and those below the average where definitely not sticking around and retaining, which was a clear indicator why having 1.3 sessions per day still resulted in such poor D7 retention.</p><p></p><p></p><details class="wp-block-details" open="open"><summary>Read more about the nitty gritty math</summary></details><p>I ran a logistic regression test on D7 retention as the dependent binary variable and sessions per day as the independent continuous variable. Basically, I want to see how much session/day explain D7 retention as these are session per day till the 6th day. Turns out it explained 24% of the variance in a complex model like retention.</p><p>The tl;dr of this table is that every 1 unit increase in average sessions/day would increase probability of player retaining to day 7 by 16%. This definitely proves that something about logging in everyday made players retain to D7. Pretty obvious when you say it out aloud but this let me put together a clear case to convince my team's Executive Producer as to why we should prioritise this project and the estimated impact of this project.</p><p></p><p></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Metric</td><td>Coefficient (β)</td><td>Odds Ratio (Exp(β))</td><td>T-Statistic</td><td>DF LPM R-Squared</td></tr><tr><td>Intercept (β₀)</td><td>0.003337018482</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Independent Var (β₁)</td><td>0.150119959</td><td>1.161973624</td><td>98.7768532830634</td><td>0.2415612125</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p></p><p></p><p> </p><div style="background: #f7fafc; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #e2e8f0; text-align: center;"><div style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 800; color: #1a202c;">Every 1 unit increase in sessions/day</div><div style="font-size: 0.75rem; font-weight: bold; color: #2d3748; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 0.05em; margin-bottom: 4px;">was 16% higher likelihood of retaning to 7 days</div></div><p> </p><p>In a world where I had more time, I would have loved to create a multivariable regression model exploring the relationship of D7 retention to session per day, session length (how long did you play each time), activation days (number of unique days played), activation days density (did you play a lot at the start or evenly spread), and game inventory linked to account level i.e. did player progress enough or feel accomplished enough to want to return the next day.

The game had a healthy D1 retention compared to industry benchmarks which means that it was making an impression, just <strong>failing to hook players into coming back and forming habits</strong>.</p><p>Proceeding with this investigation - in Guild of Guardians, you get gold and other resources for playing. And you can use those resources to get powerful heroes, stronger swords, and sturdier shields to defeat bigger monsters. What's the catch? <strong>If you don't login in enough times</strong>, you can get as much gold as you're supposed to. So <strong>you're weaker</strong>, the boss is more difficult because your weapons are weaker. This perfectly <strong>aligned with the original observation that users were logging in less than once per daily were failing to defeat specific bosses and dungeons</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To make certain that I was chasing the correct lead, I ran a survey to understand the user stories behind the data.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-image-87 post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Discord-Question.png" alt="" width="900" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-lg.webp 1024w"></figure><p></p><p></p><p>And came in hundreds of responses</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-image-89 post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Discord-responses-3.png" alt="" width="900" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-lg.webp 1024w"></figure><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized wp-image-90 post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" style="width: 900px; height: auto;" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Discord-Responses.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-lg.webp 1024w"></figure><p></p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Insight 1</strong></span></p><p><strong>There was a question about when in the day do users play the game.

With so few players seeing this screen, I could not justify the ROI of spending lots of effort to develop and implement animations</strong> and encourage the artist to stop at static design.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_.png" alt="" width="900" height="413" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_-lg.webp 1024w"><figcaption>After - An exit screen that creates a timeline and clear goal for return time</figcaption></figure><p><span style="color: #838383;"><em></em></span></p><hr><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: inherit;">Beyond just the UI and the visual user flow, there was a flaw in the progression design that would lead to an overall poor experience. The progression worked in such a way that players would unlock a weapon to create excitement, but by the time they collected all the gold to acquire that weapon, they would also simultaneously unlock the next sword. This dampened the excitement of the reward they just received, and every milestone went from being an opportunity to celebrate to a moment of setting a new goal and ignoring the achievement.</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: inherit;">The simplest fix was restructuring the existing progression in such a way that players would get all the gold required to unlock a sword over time, and they would unlock the new sword more or less around the time they got all the required gold. This created a satisfying moment upon return where players would get a sword after progressing through the campaign and immediately get to use it to kill stronger enemies. This was a pretty invisible and not related to the UI - but a highly impactful and under the hood change that made a world of difference. I need to be extra careful with this particular change as I did not want to give the player too many rewards and cannibalise monetisation.</span></p><p>User experience is a lot about feelings and sometimes those feelings are beyond the influence of pure visual design.</p><p><span style="color: #838383;"><em></em></span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"></figure><p></p><p></p><hr><p>After implementing this feature, <strong>I found out through analysing further data as a retroanalysis that players would get stuck at specific dungeons in the campaign mode and they would quit the game after trying a few more times</strong>.

Confidence in vision is key to keep the team motivated when the development period is long and uncertain.</p><p>Usually I rely on a team of data analysts but on a small, under-resourced team <strong>I had to basically also be the lead data analyst on this feature</strong>. This block of work <strong>deeply tested my ability to source data and craft hypothesis</strong> to choose the correct solutions and priorities for them. If you want to see my full in-depth analysis that I did at the start of the feature to convince, align, and motivate the team as to why these problems are important, you can read the lengthy report here - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E_Y0sQC5yAS__0F0BeOLr5f_QueWJYBsCgnhGpbD7vE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LINK</a>.
