This definitely proves that something about logging in everyday made players retain to D7. Pretty obvious when you say it out aloud but this let me put together a clear case to convince my team's Executive Producer as to why we should prioritise this project and the estimated impact of this project.</span></p><p><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em></em></span></p><p><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em></em></span></p><figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout align-center" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 85%;"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 17.1971%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>Metric</em></span></td><td style="width: 21.6889%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>Coefficient (β)</em></span></td><td style="width: 17.8388%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>Odds Ratio (Exp(β))</em></span></td><td style="width: 24.2556%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>T-Statistic</em></span></td><td style="width: 19.1222%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>DF LPM R-Squared</em></span></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 17.1971%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>Intercept (β₀)</em></span></td><td style="width: 21.6889%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>0.003337018482</em></span></td><td style="width: 17.8388%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>N/A</em></span></td><td style="width: 24.2556%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>N/A</em></span></td><td style="width: 19.1222%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>N/A</em></span></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 17.1971%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>Independent Var (β₁)</em></span></td><td style="width: 21.6889%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>0.150119959</em></span></td><td style="width: 17.8388%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>1.161973624</em></span></td><td style="width: 24.2556%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>98.7768532830634</em></span></td><td style="width: 19.1222%;"><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>0.2415612125</em></span></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em></em></span></p><p><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em></em></span></p><p><span style="color: #8f8f8f;">In a world where I had more time, I would have loved to create a multivariable <span style="color: #7f7f7f;">regression</span> model exploring the relationship of D7 retention to session per day, session length (how long did you play each time), activation days (number of unique days played), activation days density (did you play a lot at the start or evenly spread), and game inventory linked to account level i.e. did player progress enough or feel accomplished enough to want to return the next day. Alas, for another day.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The averages are different and it explains correlation. But how do I know if the problem is with session per day and not with overall ability of the game to delight? If that were true, we would see very low engagement in the first session - but the opposite was true with a healthy average 25 minutes first session length. The game had a healthy D1 retention compared to industry benchmarks which means that it was making an impression, just failing to build habits.</p><p>This observation helped me craft the hypothesis that something was off in the return to the second session and onwards. The hypothesis was that either there are no more moments of delight from Day 2 onwards or there are too many points of friction. </p><p>While both hypothesis needed to be tested, I opted to personally tackle the second point first as another part of the team had just finished updating animations and VFX which would overally increase the "wow" factor and it would be wise to wait to analyse the impact of those changes.</p><p>Proceeding with the latter part of my hypothesis - in Guild of Guardians, you get gold and other resources for playing. And you can use those resources to get powerful heroes, stronger swords, and sturdier shields to defeat bigger monsters. What's the catch? If you don't login in enough times, you can get as much gold as you're supposed to. So you're weaker, the boss is more difficult because your weapons are weaker. This perfectly aligned with the original observation that users were logging in less than once per daily.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To make certain that I was chasing the correct lead, I asked the community manager for permission and pasted the following question in Discord</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-image-87 post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Discord-Question.png" alt="" width="900" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Question-lg.png 1024w"></figure><p></p><p></p><p>And came in hundreds of responses</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-image-89 post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Discord-responses-3.png" alt="" width="900" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-responses-3-lg.png 1024w"></figure><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized wp-image-90 post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" style="width: 900px; height: auto;" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Discord-Responses.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Discord-Responses-lg.png 1024w"></figure><p></p><p></p><p>There was a question about how the game fits in people's lifestyle. Due to consent reasons I cannot post answers, but interestingly the some recurring themes were</p><p></p><p></p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ol class="wp-block-list"><li>"When I am picking up my child and waiting in the car"</li><li>"When I'm on the toilet"</li><li>"When I'm in my commute"</li></ol></li></ol><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>This meant that the game was finding place in a pretty crowded lifestyle, and had to take the shape that the users needed for it to work for them. Changing their behaviour to do what we wanted was going to be futile. Additionally, survivor bias had to be eliminated as people who churned did not answer these surveys, so a buffer was added to not overestimate how much users claimed to engage.</p><p>This helped me craft a clear persona that we were designing for - The Casual Connoisseur. They are characterised by someone who spend thousand of hours in a game, but at the start will casually try it before commiting. We were attracting a bulk of this audience via our marketing campaigns but had not adjusted our progression and pivoted our feature set to retain and hook this persona.</p><p></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p>Solution</p><p>At the current state of the game, you needed to spend 1 energy to defeat monsters automatically and automatically get gold. Given how we designed the product, a user had to login 3 times a day to get the most rewards. We just saw with data and opinions that such a cadence does not fit in the lifestyle of most of our players. And if they did not login 3 times a day, they will never get strong enough to win successfully.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So we had to do two things, build habits, and build them within a busy lifestyle.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the original flow, users had to come back to take an action and be rewarded. This did not generate any anticipation excitement at the end of your previous session for you to not forget this game and want to come back.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-108 post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/storyboard-for-setting-up-next-session.jpg" alt="" width="900" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/storyboard-for-setting-up-next-session-xs.jpg 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/storyboard-for-setting-up-next-session-sm.jpg 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/storyboard-for-setting-up-next-session-md.jpg 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/storyboard-for-setting-up-next-session-lg.jpg 1024w"></figure><p>Additionally, it was important to end a game session on a high note and make the player look forward to playing the next time as opposed to making them stop playing and forcing them away.

After brainstorming with the two of them for external perspective, I opted to remove some of the information and focused this screen on only delivering rewards, celebrating receiving rewards, and setting up goals for the players. I proceeded to take this input and make a high fidelity mockup.</p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Frame-23.png" alt="" width="900" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Frame-23-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Frame-23-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Frame-23-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Frame-23-lg.png 1024w"></figure><figcaption>I made this mockup in Figma.

The engineer on my team wanted to change this to a simple button for clarity but the UI artist made a great observation that we will not be able to do complex, eye catching, and delightful animations and VFX's with a button as well as with an image. Some examples of these improvements were that the chest would physically fill up with more coins as it collected rewards.</p><p>With alignment and buy-in from the engineering team that we want to pursue using a custom image, I decided a tutorial for the first visit to this screen was the best solution to teach the player that something which does not look like a button is actually a button. During testing, we also found out this lesson had a 100% memorisation rate, that means all of our participants of the playtest could remember the action 24 hours after the tutorial.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/afk-tutorial.png" alt="" width="900" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/afk-tutorial-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/afk-tutorial-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/afk-tutorial-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/afk-tutorial-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>This is the quick and greybox tutorial I mocked up in Figma.

I used UI data to find out how many players close the game by pressing the close button in-game that triggers this dialogue vs how many players close the game by alt+f4 or through the operating system, which is much more common for mobile. Suriprisingly, only 12% players closed it using the dialogue. With so few players seeing this screen, I could not justify the ROI of spending lots of effort to develop and implement animations and encourage the artist to stop at static design.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_.png" alt="" width="900" height="413" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/figma_e1njfafc8a__1___1_-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>This was the final design for this screen.

The progression worked in such a way that players would unlock a weapon to create excitement, but by the time they collected all the gold to acquire that weapon, they would also simultaneously unlock the next sword. This dampened the excitement of the reward they just received in the form of the sword, and every milestone went from being an opportunity to celebrate to a moment of setting a new goal without acknowledgement.<br><br>The simplest fix was restructuring the existing progression in such a way that players would get all the gold required to unlock a sword over time, and they would unlock the new sword more or less around the time they got all the required gold. This created a satisfying moment upon return where players would get a sword after progressing through the campaign and immediately get to use it to kill stronger enemies. This was a pretty invisible and not related to the UI - but a highly impactful and under the hood change that made a world of difference. I need to be extra careful with this particular change as I did not want to give the player too many rewards and cannibalise monetisation.</span></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" style="text-align: center; font-size: inherit;" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/IMG_0495.png" alt="" width="900" height="419" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/IMG_0495-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>User experience is a lot about feelings and sometimes those feelings are beyond the influence of pure visual design.

This was a highly correlated factor to low D7 retention.</p><p>After analysing the data of what heroes they were using to fight, it turned out they were using weaker strategic teams. I went around the office and asked employees who did not work on Guild of Guardians but played it regularly for their unbiased feedback on this specific issue. Many of them replied with not knowing why an enemy was powerful to then be able to infer what is the best team of heroes to use against them and only being able to proceed after getting that information from other advanced players. After a quick workshop with my team we discovered that the easiest and simplest solution we arrived to was adding a reccomendation system to the progression using server wide hero usage data.</p><p>Here is how the experience looked like previously and then after the new feature was added</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250828_080318_Guild-of-Guardians-2.png" data-size="2316x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250828_080318_Guild-of-Guardians-2-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a><figcaption>Before - players had no clue what heroes to use</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150237_Guild-of-Guardians-2.png" data-size="2316x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150237_Guild-of-Guardians-2-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a><figcaption>After - players had some recommendations based on other players' performance</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>This feature was tricky to analyse because the feature was not clickable to the user, they could only read this information. So I had no way of knowing if it was helping or not. A proxy data I used was to observe how many users used teams that were different from the recommendations in their first attempt and then used the recommended team in the next attempt to then clear the dungeon. The success of this funnel was increasing for multiple weeks until it settled in the high 60%, so I could inferred that users did get information from this feature to be able to positively impact their ability to win.</p><hr><p>Through qualitative insights from talking to players informally via Discord and analysing the conversations using AI tools, I also found out that players quit after losing once or twice because whenever they lost in a dungeon, they had to begin from the first dungeon. This design was an ill fit for a mobile game which easier and smoother progression. I collaborated directly with the game designer to add a new dungeon progression system that used checkpoints so players can instantly reattempt the dungeon that they lost at instead of having to begin from the start. This was a simply and purely UX change as no balancing or remaking of content was involved.</p><p>Here is how the experience looked like previously and then after the new feature was added</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250915_114738_Guild-of-Guardians.png" data-size="2316x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20250915_114738_Guild-of-Guardians-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a><figcaption>Before - players said that they had no sense of progression, and if they lost at room 13 of a dungeon they had to reattempt from the start</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150223_Guild-of-Guardians-1.png" data-size="2316x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/gallery/Screenshot_20251105_150223_Guild-of-Guardians-1-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="358"></a><figcaption>After - a clear progression path.

This let players experience choice and autonomy at the end of long commitment. The hypothesis was that delayed gratification would make players stay longer than day 7 in anticipation of further dopamine rushes. The UI design for this feature was specifically chosen to look like a countdown calendar so the players had something to look forward to not only the next day but also a bumper reward at the end of the week.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians.png" alt="" width="900" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251210_075732_Guild-of-Guardians-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>Daily instant gratification rewards to create micro goals and a big delayed gratification reward at the end of the week with clear goals, context, and progress to create macro goals</figcaption></figure><hr><p>One of the final changes that I added under this block of work was a moment of delight at getting the players first legendary hero. Originally players had to wait to get one from gacha or the newly implemented day 7 calendar rewards, but I added an explicit scripted moment to get the first legendary hero after defeating the first boss to make it feel celebratory and achieved by playing the game.</p><p>This decision was not informed by pre-prepared data as it is hard to analyse something that does not exist, so we A/B tested this implementation to see the impact. The players who got to experience this showed 38% higher likelihood of retaining to D7 than players who did not, which was made obvious by seeing the usage data of that legendary hero to clear out the subsequent dungeons.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/image-3.png" alt="" width="700" height="396" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/image-3-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/image-3-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/image-3-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/image-3-lg.png 1024w"><figcaption>I created this design in Figma with existing components of the design system as we did not have the availability of a UI designer for this feature</figcaption></figure><p>After the success of this moment of delight, I added a introductory offer with clear messaging to be paired with the delight for players who wished to fast track their progress in the campaign.

I rejected this as the initial setup did not have any grounding in narrative context which was something we had feedback from players in our Discord who wished for more lore and context around why certain features exist. After all, they don't want to play a video game that could have just been a spreadsheet</figcaption></figure><hr><h1>Result</h1><p></p><p></p><p>We saw our D7 retention increase by nearly 25% by the time all features were shipped.</p><p>If you remember the session per day distribution that I analysed at the start of this project, it started looking a normal distribution. The "average" fell down to 1, but more users were playing once per day and overall less users churned from the game and improved D7 retention.</p><p>In nerd terms - the bimodal distribution eventually regressed to a normal distribution, and fewer overall players churned after solving user pain points. What this means was that we no longer had a k-shaped behaviour where the most engaged players were playing so much that it pulled the average up and gave us the wrong impression of the game.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Smoother-Bell-Curve.png" alt="" width="900" height="552" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Smoother-Bell-Curve-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Smoother-Bell-Curve-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Smoother-Bell-Curve-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Smoother-Bell-Curve-lg.png 1024w"></figure><figcaption>The "average" is lower but the outcome is more consistent for more players than before with overall higher retention. That's the beauty of really understanding statistics and numbers</figcaption></figure><p>While it is difficult to attribute the results to any single change, we continuously monitored data and collected qualitative feedback through community managers engaging with the player base to gauge the estimated weighted impact of individual changes and, unsurpisingly, it followed an 80/20 principle i.e major impact came from the earliest, biggest changes (such as building up the away from keyboard idle rewards and readjusting some of the milestones and rewards) and  and the marginal gains of impact from later, smaller changes became smaller and smaller.</p><p>At that point, it made sense for me to propose to our Executive Producer to dissolve the "D7 Retention" strike team and reallocate people to other features in development.</p><p>Additionally, using free content to grab the players attention followed by a surgically placed in-app offer with very clear messaging and value proposition increased our D7 LTV (money made from a player within their first 7 days from creating an account) by over 12%! Even though this was not our goal, this was a double win for the team.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/Outcome-2-2.png" alt="" width="900" height="276" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Outcome-2-2-xs.png 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Outcome-2-2-sm.png 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Outcome-2-2-md.png 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/Outcome-2-2-lg.png 1024w"></figure><hr><h1>Learning</h1><p></p><p></p><p>This was a major block of work that took multiple months and was shipped over multiple releases. The discovery phase started by understanding that what players are lacking is beyond the screen, it's a mismatch of the game's user experience and their habits and lifestyle. Once we understood that, we knew we had to make critical changes to features besides just updating the UI.</p><p>But with hypothesis and insights backed by data about player behaviour, we could confidently commit to this long endeavour to deliver value with constant iteration and see each addition having an impact on our business goals. Confidence in vision is key to keep the team motivated when the development period is long and uncertain.</p><p> </p><div class="wp-block-group alignfull" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-top: var(--wp--preset--spacing--50); padding-bottom: var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);"><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-columns alignwide"><p></p><div class="wp-block-column" style="padding: var(--wp--preset--spacing--10);"><p></p><div class="wp-block-group"><p></p><div class="wp-block-group"><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized has-custom-border"><figure class="wp-image-94"><img loading="lazy" style="border-radius: 100px; aspect-ratio: 1; object-fit: cover; width: 60px;" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/josiah.jpeg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/josiah-xs.jpeg 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/josiah-sm.jpeg 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/josiah-md.jpeg 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/4/responsive/josiah-lg.jpeg 1024w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center is-testimonial-name has-small-font-size" style="line-height: 1;"><em>Josiah Wallace, Senior Game Design Manager</em></h3><p></p></div><p></p><p></p><blockquote><p class="has-text-align-center is-testimonial-review">"Data driven design is now a keystone in modern game development and there are few others like Bramha who combine the UX and Game Design know-how with the Data Analysis process &amp; procedure as well as he does.
