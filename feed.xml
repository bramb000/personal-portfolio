                <h1>Context</h1>
<p>My Role : Feature Owner</p>
<p>Team : 1 Designer | 1 Product Manager</p>
<p>The org's head of product was researching what new features could be added to boost engagement and create repeat visits to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://play.immutable.com</a> to acquire and retain users to deliver to other business as B2B2C value.</p>
<p>One of the top ideas on the table was a tiktok style feed that would aggregate global video game news and interperse that feed with Immutable products and games, very similar to the tiktok algorith that splits organic content to paid content in a loose 75/25 ratio. </p>
<h1>Action</h1>
<p>As just a team of two, I proposed we could just build a prototype for internal testing. I was able to leverage Claude and build a prototype in less than a day that aggregated games news from Youtube, Twitch, and RSS feeds for video game publications (e.g. - IGN) and interperse that with content of games built on Immutable from Youtube. This allowed us to quickly test what is a healthy ratio of organic vs inorganic content and what barebones features are table stakes.</p>
<p>Within just a day, I was able to prototype a simple web experience using js for frontend that leverages public APIs provided by these services. All of this was done using Claude in Cursor. I then deployed the webapp on Netlify so I could easily share it to anyone who needed to test it internally or externally.</p>
<p>You can test the prototype yourself here<br><a>https://gamerfeed.netlify.app/</a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<p>GitHub repository<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/bramb000/games-news-feed</a></p>
<p>Within 4 days we were able to quickly validate the requirements and scope of this project which was greatly assisted by a working, browser based prototype.</p>
<h1>Result</h1>
<p>The project did not proceed past the first few iterations as a prototype as we quickly discovered the challenges of scaling it and the degree of its alignment with the company's strategy was a core prohibitve factor.</p>
<h1>Learning</h1>
<p>The lack of success on the project itself was far outweighed by the immense success of being able to execute concept to working prototype in hand within a day to validate at speed. This was one of my first AI assisted projects and was a core instigator of my AI adoption to increase speed 100x. In my previous life as an amateur engineer such a project would have taken me at least 5 days.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I joined the team in 2020. Rocksmith+ was in pre-production and the Ubisoft wanted a global release on mobile, PC, and next gen game consoles (at that time, it was the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X). Very few people on the UX team had prior experience building a mobile user experiences.</p>

<p>This was the traditional Rocksmith experience - in front of a large screen. The MVP for Rocksmith+ was also built only for PC. My goal was to deliver it on Mobile and Tablets in addition to PC and Console to invite a whole new audience of guitar learners from around the globe.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Rocksmith+ mobile experience was a collection of many, many small steps. The first piece of work started with lots of user testing where we requested internal and external volunteers to play the a crude, ported version of the game on their mobile and tablet. My first few initial tests were to discover how people set up a portable device compared to playing on a PC or a TV (plugged in to a console) to understand context and environment in which this will be experienced.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The tests gleaned insights using three primary methods</p>

<p>What I quickly realised was that the UI cannot be one size fits all for this experience. Users need tons of customisability to change the experience to their needs</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The ability to zoom in and zoom out, and change field of vision, based on how far they have placed the device from themselves</li>
<li>The ability to scale the UI so that button are bigger if the device is farther away and they have to operate it while holding a guitar</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Not only did we need a responsive UI that adjusted to various form factors and aspect ratio, users needed customisability.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So we first began with working on a core responsive UI that would offer the base experience on all devices. It involved not only designing and validating layouts in Figma, but also working closely with UI engineers to build appropriate tools such as</p>

<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>UI component anchoring, so that UI elements know exactly where to stay on the hundreds of devices this game will be played</li>
<li>Anchor based scaling, so that the UI components know in what direction to scale in to remain on screen and maintain the layout</li>
<li>Aspect ratio based scaling rules, so that UI elements know exactly how to scale in proportion to the screen. We opted to use percentage based scaling</li>
<li>Aspect ratio break point table, so we can create bespoke rules for brackets of devices (some UI rules on phone were broken on tablet, some rules on tablets were broken on monitors and TVs)</li>

<p>The tricky part was making a responsive UI was the 3 dimensional objects in a virtual space. For that, I worked very closely with the UI engineers to develop a system where an anchor point was projected from the 3D dimension space into a 2D space on the screen, and the anchor point was then subjected to laws of bounds. Once the appropriate 2D anchor point was calculated for any screen, the camera adjusted in such a way that the 3D projection of it aligned as closely as possible. The result was a reactive camera system that could be configured like a 2D UI and the camera would adapt automatically. It would automatically know how much to zoom in or out and how to move left and right to make sure all the 3D objects appeared at the correct places on the screen no matter the aspect ratio and screen resolution of the device, whether it was a nearly square Ipad or a really tall phone. The MVP of this solution achieved usable display results on over 8 types of aspect ratios and different devices which broadly encompassed 90% of the devices or screens we expected the app to be used on</p>

<p>For example, on a PC you would scroll through a carousel by clicking left and right arrows. You would do the same on a game console by using the bumper buttons. But on a touch device, do you remember the last time you clicked a button to scroll? Instead you will see your feed extends beyond the screen, and you simply scroll to access those items outside the screen. The UI is built to lead to and teach these natural behaviours that Rocksmith's prototype version was missing as it was built PC first. A large part of my role was making all these small changes to the global design system and its component libraries to improve intuitiveness on mobile, PC, and consoles.</p>

<p>Accessibility was a core tenet of the experience we set out to design, this included the ability to users to customise the experience to their needs. One of the first accessibility feature we developed was allowing users to modify the scale of their UI to fine tune their mobile and tablet experience based on how far they kept their device. The distance between player and device heavily changed based on whether they were advanced guitar players or beginners, whether they played easy or difficult songs, whether they played bass or guitar, whether they played a full 34" bass or some other size, or if they played different guitars, whether they had equipment such as pedals, amps, or headphones attached. </p>

<p>This customisation system was easy to build as we had already worked on a dynamic system to make our 3D UI responsive. The original system, being built on solid technical foundations, meant that users could change their configuration at run time meaning they could change whenever they wanted and however many times they wanted.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One of the final pieces was how players interact with the UI. Some players could be on a chair using a keyboard, some could be on a couch with a PS5 controller in one hand and a guitar in another, and some could be leaning over a stool to touch a tablet screen on their kitchen table. The environments and context ranged on a wide spectrum.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is why we needed a consistent interaction system so outcomes could result from the same user actions over and over again. Since their minds and memories were occupied with guitar chords and other complex techniques, it made no sense to burden them needing to learn how to operate this UI.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first version of a unified interaction system was an interaction matrix for achieving the most important outcomes</p>

</figure>
<p><!-- /wp:table --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once we had a consistent mapping between common outcomes that users wanted and consistent mapping the same actions to them, we then made sure to map the mechanics of a device with each other to build a cohesive system that is technically sound. For example, on PC, there is a UI event called hover which is activated when a cursor enters a region and does not exit the area or make an action like a click for 600 micro seconds. This is mapped to a player hovering on an item to want more information which is common in most digital applications. For touch devices, we had an event a finger was placed on an item, but did not lift it up for 600 micro seconds. This registered as a tap and hold, which was also mapped to wanting "more information" about the item the player tapped and held. In both cases, the help tooltip was created as a hovering element next to the original element so it wasn't obscured by the cursor or the finger. This ensured that under the hood, the technical interaction system was just as consistent as the outcomes of these interactions for the users which made it easy to maintain and scale the system rapidly as the number of screens and number of instances of a component started increasing exponentially later in development.</p>

<h1>Result</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Rocksmith+ launched in open beta and swiftly followed a global launch in 2022. The mobile version was able to unlock a completely new market of on-the-go learner who did not have the money, time, or convenience of learning to play the guitar on a computer or a game console. The new and improved accessibility feature set also garnered critical acclaim when Rocksmith+ won the <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/Winners-of-the-GAconf-Accessibility-Awards-announced">Game's Accessibility Conference's award for Best physical / mobility accessibility</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But don't take my word about success on mobile, listen to real Rocksmith+ users talk about the mobile version</p>

<h1>Learning</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Working in a global team based on out San Francisco, Osaka, and Pune, I quickly learnt that project wide impact on accessibility and a multi-device philosophy won't automatically result in a great product simply with my personal contributions. A large part of team alignment came from rooting discussion in user needs and coaching the team what a truly multi device experience means which included numerous coaching and workshop sessions on mobile interactions and games. This was further challenged by language and cultural barriers during COVID 19, and meant we had to take an approach of overcommunication and active building of interpersonal relationships. While I am extremely proud of the product we put out, which helps millions of humans learn guitar at their own pace at an affordable price point, I am even more proud of the team culture we built.</p>

<p>Guild of Guardians is a hardcore RPG game where users create teams of 5 guardians to duke it out against monsters, enemies, and other players. In the first 7 to 10 days, the users are expected to play the Adventure mode where they explore the story, learn about the characters, and fight some easy monsters to learn about the game. They need to earn gold to strengthen their equipment and collect souls to level up their heroes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We had a problem, our D7 retention, the percent of players still continuing to play by the 7th day since they installed, was low. Which means we lost players who we spend lots of money to market to and acquire which reduced the efficiency of our marketing budget.</p>

<p>Being a live product, looking at data is always my first step. D7 retention is usually an indicator if players had a wow experience on their first day and if the excitement of the wow stuck. It is an objective measure of subjective fun.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A good sub-indicator of retention is to look at engagement, high engagement (many hours played) and low retention may indicate players had lots of fun at the start and then either forgot your game or got burned out. Low engagement means they simply did not enjoy it and chose not to come back.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A good stand in for habitual behaviour is to look at sessions per day, how many unique times did a user login to the game. Logging in daily means your game was both - "wow" and forming habits. Sometimes a good, fun game fails to build habits and gets forgotten because humans have access to so much entertainment.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The average sessions per day in a user's first 7 days from install was 1.3. That's good! But is it? An average does not often tell the full story. Instead, this was the full story.</p>

<p>There were two segments of users, some who played a lot, more than 1.3 times per day, and some who played less than 1.3. So if you're playing an average of less than 1, that means you're not playing everyday. That's not forming any habits. In nerd terms, this is a bimodal distribution and very few players are actually having the "average" experience, and those below the average where definitely not sticking around.</p>

<p><span style="color: #8f8f8f;"><em>I ran a logistic regression test on D7 retention as the dependent binary variable and sessions per day as the independent continuous variable. Basically, I want to see how much session/day explain D7 retention as these are session per day till the 6th day. Turns out it only explain 24% of the variance in the model, but the result is significant and the odds ratio explains that every 1 unit increase in average sessions/day would increase probability of player retaining by 16%. This definitely proves that something about logging in everyday made players retain to D7. Pretty obvious when you say it out aloud but you always have to be sure about that relationship.</em></span></p>

<p>The averages are different and it explains correlation. But how do I know if the problem is with session per day and not with overall ability of the game to delight? Well obviously I have a hunch because I play and develop video games for a living. In Guild of Guardians, you get gold for playing. And you can use that gold to get stronger swords and sturdier shields to defeat bigger monsters. What's the catch? If you don't login in enough times, you can get as much gold as you're supposed to. So you're weaker, the boss is more difficult because your weapons are rustier. Let's actually ascertain that by talking to the players</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There was a question about how the game fits in people's lifestyle. Due to consent reasons I cannot post answers, but interestingly the some recurring themes were</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>"When I am picking up my child and waiting in the car"</li>
<li>"When I'm on the toilet"</li>
<li>"When I'm in my commute"</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This meant that the game was finding place in a pretty crowded lifestyle, and had to take the shape that the users needed for it to work for them. Changing their behaviour to do what we wanted was going to be futile. Additionally, survivor bias had to be eliminated as people who churned did not answer these surveys, so a buffer was added to not overestimate how much users claimed to engage.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So comes the solution</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At the current state of the game, you needed to spend 1 energy to defeat monsters automatically and automatically get gold. Given how we designed the product, a user had to login 3 times a day to get the most rewards. We just saw with data and opinions that such a cadence does not fit in the lifestyle of most of our players. And if they did not login 3 times a day, they will never get strong enough to win successfully.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So we had to do two things, build habits, and build them within a busy lifestyle.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the original flow, users had to come back to take an action and be rewarded. This did not generate any anticipation excitement at the end of your previous session for you to not forget this game and want to come back.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":92,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><figure class="wp-image-92"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/4/Screenshot_20251110_172144_Guild-of-Guardians.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251110_172144_Guild-of-Guardians-xs.png 300w ,https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251110_172144_Guild-of-Guardians-sm.png 480w ,https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251110_172144_Guild-of-Guardians-md.png 768w ,https://bramb000.github.io/personal-portfolio/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot_20251110_172144_Guild-of-Guardians-lg.png 1024w"></figure>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>

<p><span style="color: #7f7f7f;"><em>While to the user the change was as simple not needing energy by rather having things collected for you, under the hood we changed a lot of numbers to make sure that when players came back, they had just the exact amount of gold for that new shiny sword. This created a satisfying moment upon return to immediately then get a sword and go kill a bigger bad guy. This was a pretty invisible change to most of the noob players that we were building this for to make their experience smoother and kinder.</em></span></p>

<h1>Result</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We saw our D7 retention increase by nearly 20% within the first week. The bimodal distribution became a normal distribution, and we lost fewer users to this issue.</p>

<h1>Learning</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While there were many visual iterations and the golden path was updated many times in testing, I was most proud of being able to highlight that many user needs are solved by out of the box (screen) thinking. The screen is just an abstraction, have we really checked their lives and habits to see if our products are failing in ways that we can't see? Solving real user needs requires looking past the screen and understanding the user.</p>
