I was able to leverage Claude and build a prototype in less than a day that aggregated games news from Youtube, Twitch, and RSS feeds for video game publications (e.g. - IGN) and interperse that with content of games built on Immutable from Youtube. This allowed us to quickly test what is a healthy ratio of organic vs inorganic content and what barebones features are table stakes.</p><p>Within just a day, I was able to prototype a simple web experience using javascript for frontend that leverages public APIs provided by these services. All of this was done using Claude in Cursor. I then deployed the webapp on Netlify so I could easily share it to anyone who needed to test it internally or externally.</p><p>You can test the prototype yourself here<br><a href="https://gamerfeed.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://gamerfeed.netlify.app/</a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p><p>GitHub repository<br><a href="https://github.com/bramb000/games-news-feed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/bramb000/games-news-feed</a></p><p>Within 4 days we were able to quickly validate the requirements and scope of this project which was greatly assisted by a working, browser based prototype.</p><hr><h1>Result</h1><p>The project did not proceed past the first few iterations as a prototype as we quickly discovered the challenges of scaling it and the degree of its alignment with the company's strategy was a core prohibitve factor.</p><hr><h1>Learning</h1><p>The lack of success on the project itself was far outweighed by the immense success of being able to execute concept to working prototype in hand within a day to validate at speed. This was one of my first AI assisted projects and was a core instigator of my AI adoption to increase speed 100x. In my previous life as an amateur engineer such a project would have taken me at least 5 days.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">All Rights Reserved Bramha Dalvi</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://bramha.work/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=4268bfae06e330d473c424d50f09abda"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
