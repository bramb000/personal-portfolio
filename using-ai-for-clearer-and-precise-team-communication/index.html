Since the scope of our project was larger than the team size and we were unwilling to reduce scope and bar for quality, we had to automate many functions that did not have a clear owner.</p><p>One of the main problems was maintaining sources of truth for design, stakeholders from marketing to QA needed to know the latest changes to the design documents. As we did not have a dedicated project manager, I opted to build an AI tools that would answer all questions.</p><hr><h1>Action</h1><p>Using N8N and Slack, I build Bramha Bot. This is a Slack integrated tool that can answer all project management and design questions by reading the project management tracker and all associated design documents.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/13/image.png" alt="" width="1573" height="697" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/13/responsive/image-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/13/responsive/image-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/13/responsive/image-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/13/responsive/image-lg.webp 1024w"><figcaption>AI used in an N8N workflow</figcaption></figure><p>You can simply ask questions like "@Bramha Bot, when will the new leaderboard feature release?" for clarity on dates. But imagine you're a marketing person and you want to know the design intent of the feature to be able to create better communication material, then you can also ask "@Bramha Bot, how are players expected to interact with this feature" and the bot will answer based on what it knows is written in the document by the original human designer.</p><p>Here is a screenshot of a real Slack message that the AI agent replies to with correct answers regarding schedule and design questions</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://bramha.work/media/posts/13/Frame-9.png" alt="" width="345" height="1277" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://bramha.work/media/posts/13/responsive/Frame-9-xs.webp 300w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/13/responsive/Frame-9-sm.webp 480w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/13/responsive/Frame-9-md.webp 768w, https://bramha.work/media/posts/13/responsive/Frame-9-lg.webp 1024w"></figure><hr><h1>Result</h1><p>From the first day, the AI Agent was getting 15 mentions a day! It was very popular in the team and the personal mentions per person with questions such as "Hey what are the dates for this event" or "Hey can you quickly explain to me how Feature Y will work" reduced by over 30%, allowing everyone to focus on their craft and delivering output instead of answering questions. Because of the conversational nature of the bot, it saved hours of time for people who would have to self serve their questions by reading 20+ page documents.</p><hr><h1>Learning</h1><p>A big part of design is to communicate clearly and spread your ideas and provide context amongst the team. I am always interested in using new tools and technologies for levelling up processes and communication to maintain quality of output and make my team's life easier.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">All Rights Reserved Bramha Dalvi</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://bramha.work/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=4268bfae06e330d473c424d50f09abda"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
